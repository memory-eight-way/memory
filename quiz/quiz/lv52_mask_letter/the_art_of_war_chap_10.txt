X. TERR_IN


1. Sun Tzu s_id: We m_y distinguish six kinds of terr_in, to wit: (1) ___essi_le ground; (2) ent_ngling ground; (3) temporizing ground; (4) n_rrow p_sses; (5) pre_ipitous heights; (6) positions _t _ gre_t dist_n_e from the enemy.


2. Ground whi_h __n _e freely tr_versed _y _oth sides is __lled ___essi_le.


3-1. With reg_rd to ground of this n_ture, _e _efore the enemy in o__upying the r_ised _nd sunny spots, _nd __refully gu_rd your line of supplies.


3-2. Then you will _e __le to fight with _dv_nt_ge.


4. Ground whi_h __n _e ___ndoned _ut is h_rd to re-o__upy is __lled ent_ngling.


5-1. From _ position of this sort, if the enemy is unprep_red, you m_y s_lly forth _nd defe_t him.


5-2. _ut if the enemy is prep_red for your _oming, _nd you f_il to defe_t him, then, return _eing impossi_le, dis_ster will ensue.


6. When the position is su_h th_t neither side will g_in _y m_king the first move, it is __lled temporizing ground.


7. In _ position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us _n _ttr__tive __it, it will _e _dvis__le not to stir forth, _ut r_ther to retre_t, thus enti_ing the enemy in his turn; then, when p_rt of his _rmy h_s _ome out, we m_y deliver our _tt__k with _dv_nt_ge.


8. With reg_rd to n_rrow p_sses, if you __n o__upy them first, let them _e strongly g_rrisoned _nd _w_it the _dvent of the enemy.


9. Should the _rmy forest_ll you in o__upying _ p_ss, do not go _fter him if the p_ss is fully g_rrisoned, _ut only if it is we_kly g_rrisoned.


10. With reg_rd to pre_ipitous heights, if you _re _eforeh_nd with your _dvers_ry, you should o__upy the r_ised _nd sunny spots, _nd there w_it for him to _ome up.


11. If the enemy h_s o__upied them _efore you, do not follow him, _ut retre_t _nd try to enti_e him _w_y.


12. If you _re situ_ted _t _ gre_t dist_n_e from the enemy, _nd the strength of the two _rmies is equ_l, it is not e_sy to provoke _ __ttle, _nd fighting will _e to your dis_dv_nt_ge.


13-1. These six _re the prin_iples _onne_ted with E_rth.


13-2. The gener_l who h_s _tt_ined _ responsi_le post must _e __reful to study them.


14-1. Now _n _rmy is exposed to six sever_l __l_mities, not _rising from n_tur_l __uses, _ut from f_ults for whi_h the gener_l is responsi_le.


14-2. These _re: (1) Flight; (2) insu_ordin_tion; (3) _oll_pse; (4) ruin; (5) disorg_niz_tion; (6) rout.


15. Other _onditions _eing equ_l, if one for_e is hurled _g_inst _nother ten times its size, the result will _e the flight of the former.


16-1. When the _ommon soldiers _re too strong _nd their offi_ers too we_k, the result is insu_ordin_tion.


16-2. When the offi_ers _re too strong _nd the _ommon soldiers too we_k, the result is _oll_pse.


17. When the higher offi_ers _re _ngry _nd insu_ordin_te, _nd on meeting the enemy give __ttle on their own ___ount from _ feeling of resentment, _efore the _omm_nder-in-_hief __n tell whether or not he is in _ position to fight, the result is ruin.


18. When the gener_l is we_k _nd without _uthority; when his orders _re not _le_r _nd distin_t; when there _re no fixes duties _ssigned to offi_ers _nd men, _nd the r_nks _re formed in _ slovenly h_ph_z_rd m_nner, the result is utter disorg_niz_tion.


19. When _ gener_l, un__le to estim_te the enemy's strength, _llows _n inferior for_e to eng_ge _ l_rger one, or hurls _ we_k det__hment _g_inst _ powerful one, _nd negle_ts to pl__e pi_ked soldiers in the front r_nk, the result must _e rout.


20. These _re six w_ys of _ourting defe_t, whi_h must _e __refully noted _y the gener_l who h_s _tt_ined _ responsi_le post.


21. The n_tur_l form_tion of the _ountry is the soldier's _est _lly; _ut _ power of estim_ting the _dvers_ry, of _ontrolling the for_es of vi_tory, _nd of shrewdly __l_ul_ting diffi_ulties, d_ngers _nd dist_n_es, _onstitutes the test of _ gre_t gener_l.


22-1. He who knows these things, _nd in fighting puts his knowledge into pr__ti_e, will win his __ttles.


22-2. He who knows them not, nor pr__ti_es them, will surely _e defe_ted.


23. If fighting is sure to result in vi_tory, then you must fight, even though the ruler for_id it; if fighting will not result in vi_tory, then you must not fight even _t the ruler's _idding.


24. The gener_l who _dv_n_es without _oveting f_me _nd retre_ts without fe_ring disgr__e, whose only thought is to prote_t his _ountry _nd do good servi_e for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.


25. Reg_rd your soldiers _s your _hildren, _nd they will follow you into the deepest v_lleys; look upon them _s your own _eloved sons, _nd they will st_nd _y you even unto de_th.


26. If, however, you _re indulgent, _ut un__le to m_ke your _uthority felt; kind-he_rted, _ut un__le to enfor_e your _omm_nds; _nd in__p__le, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must _e likened to spoilt _hildren; they _re useless for _ny pr__ti__l purpose.


27. If we know th_t our own men _re in _ _ondition to _tt__k, _ut _re un_w_re th_t the enemy is not open to _tt__k, we h_ve gone only h_lfw_y tow_rds vi_tory.


28. If we know th_t the enemy is open to _tt__k, _ut _re un_w_re th_t our own men _re not in _ _ondition to _tt__k, we h_ve gone only h_lfw_y tow_rds vi_tory.


29. If we know th_t the enemy is open to _tt__k, _nd _lso know th_t our men _re in _ _ondition to _tt__k, _ut _re un_w_re th_t the n_ture of the ground m_kes fighting impr__ti___le, we h_ve still gone only h_lfw_y tow_rds vi_tory.


30. Hen_e the experien_ed soldier, on_e in motion, is never _ewildered; on_e he h_s _roken __mp, he is never _t _ loss.


31. Hen_e the s_ying: If you know the enemy _nd know yourself, your vi_tory will not st_nd in dou_t; if you know He_ven _nd know E_rth, you m_y m_ke your vi_tory _omplete.
