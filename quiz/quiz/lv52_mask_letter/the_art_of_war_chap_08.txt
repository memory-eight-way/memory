VIII. V_RI_TION IN T__TI_S


1. Sun Tzu s_id: In w_r, the gener_l re_eives his _omm_nds from the sovereign, _olle_ts his _rmy _nd _on_entr_tes his for_es.


2-1. When in diffi_ult _ountry, do not en__mp.


2-2. In _ountry where high ro_ds interse_t, join h_nds with your _llies.


2-3. Do not linger in d_ngerously isol_ted positions.


2-4. In hemmed-in situ_tions, you must resort to str_t_gem.


2-5. In desper_te position, you must fight.


3. There _re ro_ds whi_h must not _e followed, _rmies whi_h must _e not _tt__ked, towns whi_h must not _e _esieged, positions whi_h must not _e _ontested, _omm_nds of the sovereign whi_h must not _e o_eyed.


4. The gener_l who thoroughly underst_nds the _dv_nt_ges th_t ___omp_ny v_ri_tion of t__ti_s knows how to h_ndle his troops.


5. The gener_l who does not underst_nd these, m_y _e well __qu_inted with the _onfigur_tion of the _ountry, yet he will not _e __le to turn his knowledge to pr__ti__l ___ount.


6. So, the student of w_r who is unversed in the _rt of w_r of v_rying his pl_ns, even though he _e __qu_inted with the Five _dv_nt_ges, will f_il to m_ke the _est use of his men.


7. Hen_e in the wise le_der's pl_ns, _onsider_tions of _dv_nt_ge _nd of dis_dv_nt_ge will _e _lended together.


8. If our expe_t_tion of _dv_nt_ge _e tempered in this w_y, we m_y su__eed in ___omplishing the essenti_l p_rt of our s_hemes.


9. If, on the other h_nd, in the midst of diffi_ulties we _re _lw_ys re_dy to seize _n _dv_nt_ge, we m_y extri__te ourselves from misfortune.


10. Redu_e the hostile _hiefs _y infli_ting d_m_ge on them; _nd m_ke trou_le for them, _nd keep them _onst_ntly eng_ged; hold out spe_ious _llurements, _nd m_ke them rush to _ny given point.


11. The _rt of w_r te__hes us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not _oming, _ut on our own re_diness to re_eive him; not on the _h_n_e of his not _tt__king, _ut r_ther on the f__t th_t we h_ve m_de our position un_ss_il__le.


12. There _re five d_ngerous f_ults whi_h m_y _ffe_t _ gener_l: (1) Re_klessness, whi_h le_ds to destru_tion; (2) _ow_rdi_e, whi_h le_ds to __pture; (3) _ h_sty temper, whi_h __n _e provoked _y insults; (4) _ deli___y of honor whi_h is sensitive to sh_me; (5) over-soli_itude for his men, whi_h exposes him to worry _nd trou_le.


13. These _re the five _esetting sins of _ gener_l, ruinous to the _ondu_t of w_r.


14-1. When _n _rmy is overthrown _nd its le_der sl_in, the __use will surely _e found _mong these five d_ngerous f_ults.


14-2. Let them _e _ su_je_t of medit_tion.
