I. L_YING PL_NS


1. Sun Tzu s_id: The _rt of w_r is of vit_l import_n_e to the St_te.


2-1. It is _ m_tter of life _nd de_th, _ ro_d either to s_fety or to ruin.


2-2. Hen_e it is _ su_je_t of inquiry whi_h __n on no ___ount _e negle_ted.


3. The _rt of w_r, then, is governed _y five _onst_nt f__tors, to _e t_ken into ___ount in one's deli_er_tions, when seeking to determine the _onditions o_t_ining in the field.


4. These _re: (1) The Mor_l L_w; (2) He_ven; (3) E_rth; (4) The _omm_nder; (5) Method _nd dis_ipline.


5,6. The Mor_l L_w __uses the people to _e in _omplete ___ord with their ruler, so th_t they will follow him reg_rdless of their lives, undism_yed _y _ny d_nger.


7. He_ven signifies night _nd d_y, _old _nd he_t, times _nd se_sons.


8. E_rth _omprises dist_n_es, gre_t _nd sm_ll; d_nger _nd se_urity; open ground _nd n_rrow p_sses; the _h_n_es of life _nd de_th.


9. The _omm_nder st_nds for the virtues of wisdom, sin_erity, _enevolen_e, _our_ge _nd stri_tness.


10. _y method _nd dis_ipline _re to _e understood the m_rsh_ling of the _rmy in its proper su_divisions, the gr_du_tions of r_nk _mong the offi_ers, the m_inten_n_e of ro_ds _y whi_h supplies m_y re__h the _rmy, _nd the _ontrol of milit_ry expenditure.


11. These five he_ds should _e f_mili_r to every gener_l: he who knows them will _e vi_torious; he who knows them not will f_il.


12. Therefore, in your deli_er_tions, when seeking to determine the milit_ry _onditions, let them _e m_de the __sis of _ _omp_rison, in this wise:--


13-1. (1) Whi_h of the two sovereigns is im_ued with the Mor_l l_w?


13-2. (2) Whi_h of the two gener_ls h_s most __ility?


13-3. (3) With whom lie the _dv_nt_ges derived from He_ven _nd E_rth?


13-4. (4) On whi_h side is dis_ipline most rigorously enfor_ed?


13-5. (5) Whi_h _rmy is stronger?


13-6. (6) On whi_h side _re offi_ers _nd men more highly tr_ined?


13-7. (7) In whi_h _rmy is there the gre_ter _onst_n_y _oth in rew_rd _nd punishment?


14. _y me_ns of these seven _onsider_tions I __n fore__st vi_tory or defe_t.


15-1. The gener_l th_t he_rkens to my _ounsel _nd __ts upon it, will _onquer: let su_h _ one _e ret_ined in _omm_nd!


15-2. The gener_l th_t he_rkens not to my _ounsel nor __ts upon it, will suffer defe_t:-- let su_h _ one _e dismissed!


16. While he_ding the profit of my _ounsel, _v_il yourself _lso of _ny helpful _ir_umst_n_es over _nd _eyond the ordin_ry rules.


17. ___ording _s _ir_umst_n_es _re f_vor__le, one should modify one's pl_ns.


18. _ll w_rf_re is __sed on de_eption.


19. Hen_e, when __le to _tt__k, we must seem un__le; when using our for_es, we must seem in__tive; when we _re ne_r, we must m_ke the enemy _elieve we _re f_r _w_y; when f_r _w_y, we must m_ke him _elieve we _re ne_r.


20-1. Hold out __its to enti_e the enemy.


20-2. Feign disorder, _nd _rush him.


21-1. If he is se_ure _t _ll points, _e prep_red for him.


21-2. If he is in superior strength, ev_de him.


22-1. If your opponent is of _holeri_ temper, seek to irrit_te him.


22-2. Pretend to _e we_k, th_t he m_y grow _rrog_nt.


23-1. If he is t_king his e_se, give him no rest.


23-2. If his for_es _re united, sep_r_te them.


24. _tt__k him where he is unprep_red, _ppe_r where you _re not expe_ted.


25. These milit_ry devi_es, le_ding to vi_tory, must not _e divulged _eforeh_nd.


26-1. Now the gener_l who wins _ __ttle m_kes m_ny __l_ul_tions in his temple ere the __ttle is fought.


26-2. The gener_l who loses _ __ttle m_kes _ut few __l_ul_tions _eforeh_nd.


26-3. Thus do m_ny __l_ul_tions le_d to vi_tory, _nd few __l_ul_tions to defe_t: how mu_h more no __l_ul_tion _t _ll!


26-4. It is _y _ttention to this point th_t I __n foresee who is likely to win or lose.
