III. _TT__K _Y STR_T_GEM

1-1. Sun Tzu s_id: In the pr__ti__l _rt of w_r, the _est thing of _ll is to t_ke the enemy's _ountry whole _nd int__t; to sh_tter _nd destroy it is not so good.

1-2. So, too, it is _etter to re__pture _n _rmy entire th_n to destroy it, to __pture _ regiment, _ det__hment or _ _omp_ny entire th_n to destroy them.

2. Hen_e to fight _nd _onquer in _ll your __ttles is not supreme ex_ellen_e; supreme ex_ellen_e _onsists in _re_king the enemy's resist_n_e without fighting.

3. Thus the highest form of gener_lship is to __lk the enemy's pl_ns; the next _est is to prevent the jun_tion of the enemy's for_es; the next in order is to _tt__k the enemy's _rmy in the field; _nd the worst poli_y of _ll is to _esiege w_lled _ities.

4-1. The rule is, not to _esiege w_lled _ities if it __n possi_ly _e _voided.

4-2. The prep_r_tion of m_ntlets, mov__le shelters, _nd v_rious implements of w_r, will t_ke up three whole months; _nd the piling up of mounds over _g_inst the w_lls will t_ke three months more.

5-1. The gener_l, un__le to _ontrol his irrit_tion, will l_un_h his men to the _ss_ult like sw_rming _nts, with the result th_t one-third of his men _re sl_in, while the town still rem_ins unt_ken.

5-2. Su_h _re the dis_strous effe_ts of _ siege.

6. Therefore the skillful le_der su_dues the enemy's troops without _ny fighting; he __ptures their _ities without l_ying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy oper_tions in the field.

7-1. With his for_es int__t he will dispute the m_stery of the Empire, _nd thus, without losing _ m_n, his triumph will _e _omplete.

7-2. This is the method of _tt__king _y str_t_gem.

8. It is the rule in w_r, if our for_es _re ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to _tt__k him; if twi_e _s numerous, to divide our _rmy into two.

9. If equ_lly m_t_hed, we __n offer __ttle; if slightly inferior in num_ers, we __n _void the enemy; if quite unequ_l in every w_y, we __n flee from him.

10. Hen_e, though _n o_stin_te fight m_y _e m_de _y _ sm_ll for_e, in the end it must _e __ptured _y the l_rger for_e.

11. Now the gener_l is the _ulw_rk of the St_te; if the _ulw_rk is _omplete _t _ll points; the St_te will _e strong; if the _ulw_rk is defe_tive, the St_te will _e we_k.

12. There _re three w_ys in whi_h _ ruler __n _ring misfortune upon his _rmy:--

13-1. (1) _y _omm_nding the _rmy to _dv_n_e or to retre_t, _eing ignor_nt of the f__t th_t it __nnot o_ey.

13-2. This is __lled ho__ling the _rmy.

14-1. (2) _y _ttempting to govern _n _rmy in the s_me w_y _s he _dministers _ kingdom, _eing ignor_nt of the _onditions whi_h o_t_in in _n _rmy.

14-2. This __uses restlessness in the soldier's minds.

15-1. (3) _y employing the offi_ers of his _rmy without dis_rimin_tion, through ignor_n_e of the milit_ry prin_iple of _d_pt_tion to _ir_umst_n_es.

15-2. This sh_kes the _onfiden_e of the soldiers.

16-1. _ut when the _rmy is restless _nd distrustful, trou_le is sure to _ome from the other feud_l prin_es.

16-2. This is simply _ringing _n_r_hy into the _rmy, _nd flinging vi_tory _w_y.

17-1. Thus we m_y know th_t there _re five essenti_ls for vi_tory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight _nd when not to fight.

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to h_ndle _oth superior _nd inferior for_es.

17-3. (3) He will win whose _rmy is _nim_ted _y the s_me spirit throughout _ll its r_nks.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prep_red himself, w_its to t_ke the enemy unprep_red.

17-5. (5) He will win who h_s milit_ry __p__ity _nd is not interfered with _y the sovereign.

18-1. Hen_e the s_ying: If you know the enemy _nd know yourself, you need not fe_r the result of _ hundred __ttles.

18-2. If you know yourself _ut not the enemy, for every vi_tory g_ined you will _lso suffer _ defe_t.

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will su__um_ in every __ttle.
