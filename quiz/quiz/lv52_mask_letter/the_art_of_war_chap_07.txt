VII. M_NEUVERING


1. Sun Tzu s_id: In w_r, the gener_l re_eives his _omm_nds from the sovereign.


2. H_ving _olle_ted _n _rmy _nd _on_entr_ted his for_es, he must _lend _nd h_rmonize the different elements thereof _efore pit_hing his __mp.


3-1. _fter th_t, _omes t__ti__l m_neuvering, th_n whi_h there is nothing more diffi_ult.


3-2. The diffi_ulty of t__ti__l m_neuvering _onsists in turning the devious into the dire_t, _nd misfortune into g_in.


4. Thus, to t_ke _ long _nd _ir_uitous route, _fter enti_ing the enemy out of the w_y, _nd though st_rting _fter him, to _ontrive to re__h the go_l _efore him, shows knowledge of the _rtifi_e of DEVI_TION.


5. M_neuvering with _n _rmy is _dv_nt_geous; with _n undis_iplined multitude, most d_ngerous.


6-1. If you set _ fully equipped _rmy in m_r_h in order to sn_t_h _n _dv_nt_ge, the _h_n_es _re th_t you will _e too l_te.


6-2. On the other h_nd, to det__h _ flying _olumn for the purpose involves the s__rifi_e of its __gg_ge _nd stores.


7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their _uff-_o_ts, _nd m_ke for_ed m_r_hes without h_lting d_y or night, _overing dou_le the usu_l dist_n_e _t _ stret_h, doing _ hundred LI in order to wrest _n _dv_nt_ge, the le_ders of _ll your three divisions will f_ll into the h_nds of the enemy.


8. The stronger men will _e in front, the j_ded ones will f_ll _ehind, _nd on this pl_n only one-tenth of your _rmy will re__h its destin_tion.


9. If you m_r_h fifty LI in order to outm_neuver the enemy, you will lose the le_der of your first division, _nd only h_lf your for_e will re__h the go_l.


10. If you m_r_h thirty LI with the s_me o_je_t, two-thirds of your _rmy will _rrive.


11. We m_y t_ke it then th_t _n _rmy without its __gg_ge-tr_in is lost; without provisions it is lost; without __ses of supply it is lost.


12. We __nnot enter into _lli_n_es until we _re __qu_inted with the designs of our neigh_ors.


13. We _re not fit to le_d _n _rmy on the m_r_h unless we _re f_mili_r with the f__e of the _ountry-- its mount_ins _nd forests, its pitf_lls _nd pre_ipi_es, its m_rshes _nd sw_mps.


14. We sh_ll _e un__le to turn n_tur_l _dv_nt_ge to ___ount unless we m_ke use of lo__l guides.


15. In w_r, pr__ti_e dissimul_tion, _nd you will su__eed.


16. Whether to _on_entr_te or to divide your troops, must _e de_ided _y _ir_umst_n_es.


17. Let your r_pidity _e th_t of the wind, your _omp__tness th_t of the forest.


18. In r_iding _nd plundering _e like fire, in immov__ility like _ mount_in.


19. Let your pl_ns _e d_rk _nd impenetr__le _s night, _nd when you move, f_ll like _ thunder_olt.


20. When you plunder _ _ountryside, let the spoil _e divided _mongst your men; when you __pture new territory, _ut it up into _llotments for the _enefit of the soldiery.


21. Ponder _nd deli_er_te _efore you m_ke _ move.


22-1. He will _onquer who h_s le_rnt the _rtifi_e of devi_tion.


22-2. Su_h is the _rt of m_neuvering.


23-1. The _ook of _rmy M_n_gement s_ys: On the field of __ttle, the spoken word does not __rry f_r enough: hen_e the institution of gongs _nd drums.


23-2. Nor __n ordin_ry o_je_ts _e seen _le_rly enough: hen_e the institution of __nners _nd fl_gs.


24. Gongs _nd drums, __nners _nd fl_gs, _re me_ns where_y the e_rs _nd eyes of the host m_y _e fo_used on one p_rti_ul_r point.


25-1. The host thus forming _ single united _ody, is it impossi_le either for the _r_ve to _dv_n_e _lone, or for the _ow_rdly to retre_t _lone.


25-2. This is the _rt of h_ndling l_rge m_sses of men.


26. In night-fighting, then, m_ke mu_h use of sign_l-fires _nd drums, _nd in fighting _y d_y, of fl_gs _nd __nners, _s _ me_ns of influen_ing the e_rs _nd eyes of your _rmy.


27. _ whole _rmy m_y _e ro__ed of its spirit; _ _omm_nder-in-_hief m_y _e ro__ed of his presen_e of mind.


28. Now _ soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; _y noond_y it h_s _egun to fl_g; _nd in the evening, his mind is _ent only on returning to __mp.


29-1. _ _lever gener_l, therefore, _voids _n _rmy when its spirit is keen, _ut _tt__ks it when it is sluggish _nd in_lined to return.


29-2. This is the _rt of studying moods.


30. Dis_iplined _nd __lm, to _w_it the _ppe_r_n_e of disorder _nd hu__u_ _mongst the enemy:-- this is the _rt of ret_ining self-possession.


31. To _e ne_r the go_l while the enemy is still f_r from it, to w_it _t e_se while the enemy is toiling _nd struggling, to _e well-fed while the enemy is f_mished:-- this is the _rt of hus__nding one's strength.


32. To refr_in from inter_epting _n enemy whose __nners _re in perfe_t order, to refr_in from _tt__king _n _rmy dr_wn up in __lm _nd _onfident _rr_y:-- this is the _rt of studying _ir_umst_n_es.


33. It is _ milit_ry _xiom not to _dv_n_e uphill _g_inst the enemy, nor to oppose him when he _omes downhill.


34. Do not pursue _n enemy who simul_tes flight; do not _tt__k soldiers whose temper is keen.


35-1. Do not sw_llow __it offered _y the enemy.


35-2. Do not interfere with _n _rmy th_t is returning home.


36-1. When you surround _n _rmy, le_ve _n outlet free.


36-2. Do not press _ desper_te foe too h_rd.


37. Su_h is the _rt of w_rf_re.
