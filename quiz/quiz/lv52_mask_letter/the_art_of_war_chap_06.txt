VI. WE_K POINTS _ND STRONG




1. Sun Tzu s_id: Whoever is first in the field _nd _w_its the _oming of the enemy, will _e fresh for the fight; whoever is se_ond in the field _nd h_s to h_sten to __ttle will _rrive exh_usted.


2. Therefore the _lever _om__t_nt imposes his will on the enemy, _ut does not _llow the enemy's will to _e imposed on him.


3. _y holding out _dv_nt_ges to him, he __n __use the enemy to _ppro__h of his own ___ord; or, _y infli_ting d_m_ge, he __n m_ke it impossi_le for the enemy to dr_w ne_r.


4. If the enemy is t_king his e_se, he __n h_r_ss him; if well supplied with food, he __n st_rve him out; if quietly en__mped, he __n for_e him to move.


5. _ppe_r _t points whi_h the enemy must h_sten to defend; m_r_h swiftly to pl__es where you _re not expe_ted.


6. _n _rmy m_y m_r_h gre_t dist_n_es without distress, if it m_r_hes through _ountry where the enemy is not.


7-1. You __n _e sure of su__eeding in your _tt__ks if you only _tt__k pl__es whi_h _re undefended.


7-2. You __n ensure the s_fety of your defense if you only hold positions th_t __nnot _e _tt__ked.


8. Hen_e th_t gener_l is skillful in _tt__k whose opponent does not know wh_t to defend; _nd he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know wh_t to _tt__k.


9-1. O divine _rt of su_tlety _nd se_re_y!


9-2. Through you we le_rn to _e invisi_le, through you in_udi_le; _nd hen_e we __n hold the enemy's f_te in our h_nds.


10. You m_y _dv_n_e _nd _e __solutely irresisti_le, if you m_ke for the enemy's we_k points; you m_y retire _nd _e s_fe from pursuit if your movements _re more r_pid th_n those of the enemy.


11-1. If we wish to fight, the enemy __n _e for_ed to _n eng_gement even though he _e sheltered _ehind _ high r_mp_rt _nd _ deep dit_h.


11-2. _ll we need do is _tt__k some other pl__e th_t he will _e o_liged to relieve.


12-1. If we do not wish to fight, we __n prevent the enemy from eng_ging us even though the lines of our en__mpment _e merely tr__ed out on the ground.


12-2. _ll we need do is to throw something odd _nd un___ount__le in his w_y.


13. _y dis_overing the enemy's dispositions _nd rem_ining invisi_le ourselves, we __n keep our for_es _on_entr_ted, while the enemy's must _e divided.


14-1. We __n form _ single united _ody, while the enemy must split up into fr__tions.


14-2. Hen_e there will _e _ whole pitted _g_inst sep_r_te p_rts of _ whole, whi_h me_ns th_t we sh_ll _e m_ny to the enemy's few.


15. _nd if we _re __le thus to _tt__k _n inferior for_e with _ superior one, our opponents will _e in dire str_its.


16. The spot where we intend to fight must not _e m_de known; for then the enemy will h_ve to prep_re _g_inst _ possi_le _tt__k _t sever_l different points; _nd his for_es _eing thus distri_uted in m_ny dire_tions, the num_ers we sh_ll h_ve to f__e _t _ny given point will _e proportion_tely few.


17-1. For should the enemy strengthen his v_n, he will we_ken his re_r; should he strengthen his re_r, he will we_ken his v_n; should he strengthen his left, he will we_ken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will we_ken his left.


17-2. If he sends reinfor_ements everywhere, he will everywhere _e we_k.


18. Numeri__l we_kness _omes from h_ving to prep_re _g_inst possi_le _tt__ks; numeri__l strength, from _ompelling our _dvers_ry to m_ke these prep_r_tions _g_inst us.


19. Knowing the pl__e _nd the time of the _oming __ttle, we m_y _on_entr_te from the gre_test dist_n_es in order to fight.


20-1. _ut if neither time nor pl__e _e known, then the left wing will _e impotent to su__or the right, the right equ_lly impotent to su__or the left, the v_n un__le to relieve the re_r, or the re_r to support the v_n.


20-2. How mu_h more so if the furthest portions of the _rmy _re _nything under _ hundred LI _p_rt, _nd even the ne_rest _re sep_r_ted _y sever_l LI!


21-1. Though ___ording to my estim_te the soldiers of Yueh ex_eed our own in num_er, th_t sh_ll _dv_nt_ge them nothing in the m_tter of vi_tory.


21-2. I s_y then th_t vi_tory __n _e __hieved.


22-1. Though the enemy _e stronger in num_ers, we m_y prevent him from fighting.


22-2. S_heme so _s to dis_over his pl_ns _nd the likelihood of their su__ess.


23-1. Rouse him, _nd le_rn the prin_iple of his __tivity or in__tivity.


23-2. For_e him to reve_l himself, so _s to find out his vulner__le spots.


24. __refully _omp_re the opposing _rmy with your own, so th_t you m_y know where strength is super__und_nt _nd where it is defi_ient.


25. In m_king t__ti__l dispositions, the highest pit_h you __n _tt_in is to _on_e_l them; _on_e_l your dispositions, _nd you will _e s_fe from the prying of the su_tlest spies, from the m__hin_tions of the wisest _r_ins.


26. How vi_tory m_y _e produ_ed for them out of the enemy's own t__ti_s-- th_t is wh_t the multitude __nnot _omprehend.


27. _ll men __n see the t__ti_s where_y I _onquer, _ut wh_t none __n see is the str_tegy out of whi_h vi_tory is evolved.
28. Do not repe_t the t__ti_s whi_h h_ve g_ined you one vi_tory, _ut let your methods _e regul_ted _y the infinite v_riety of _ir_umst_n_es.


29. Milit_ry t__ti_s _re like unto w_ter; for w_ter in its n_tur_l _ourse runs _w_y from high pl__es _nd h_stens downw_rds.


30. So in w_r, the w_y is to _void wh_t is strong _nd to strike _t wh_t is we_k.


31. W_ter sh_pes its _ourse ___ording to the n_ture of the ground over whi_h it flows; the soldier works out his vi_tory in rel_tion to the foe whom he is f__ing.


32. Therefore, just _s w_ter ret_ins no _onst_nt sh_pe, so in w_rf_re there _re no _onst_nt _onditions.


33. He who __n modify his t__ti_s in rel_tion to his opponent _nd there_y su__eed in winning, m_y _e __lled _ he_ven-_orn __pt_in.


34-1. The five elements (w_ter, fire, wood, met_l, e_rth) _re not _lw_ys equ_lly predomin_nt; the four se_sons m_ke w_y for e__h other in turn.


34-2. There _re short d_ys _nd long; the moon h_s its periods of w_ning _nd w_xing.
