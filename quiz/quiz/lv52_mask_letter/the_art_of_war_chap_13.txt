1-1. Sun Tzu s_id: R_ising _ host of _ hundred thous_nd men _nd m_r_hing them gre_t dist_n_es ent_ils he_vy loss on the people _nd _ dr_in on the resour_es of the St_te.

2-1. Hostile _rmies m_y f__e e__h other for ye_rs, striving for the vi_tory whi_h is de_ided in _ single d_y.

2-2. This _eing so, to rem_in in ignor_n_e of the enemy's _ondition simply _e__use one grudges the outl_y of _ hundred oun_es of silver in honors _nd emoluments, is the height of inhum_nity.

3. One who __ts thus is no le_der of men, no present help to his sovereign, no m_ster of vi_tory.

4. Thus, wh_t en__les the wise sovereign _nd the good gener_l to strike _nd _onquer, _nd __hieve things _eyond the re__h of ordin_ry men, is foreknowledge.

5. Now this foreknowledge __nnot _e eli_ited from spirits; it __nnot _e o_t_ined indu_tively from experien_e, nor _y _ny dedu_tive __l_ul_tion.

6. Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions __n only _e o_t_ined from other men.

7. Hen_e the use of spies, of whom there _re five _l_sses: (1) Lo__l spies; (2) inw_rd spies; (3) _onverted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.

8-1. When these five kinds of spy _re _ll _t work, none __n dis_over the se_ret system.

8-2. This is __lled "divine m_nipul_tion of the thre_ds."

8-3. It is the sovereign's most pre_ious f__ulty.

9. H_ving lo__l spies me_ns employing the servi_es of the inh__it_nts of _ distri_t.

10. H_ving inw_rd spies, m_king use of offi_i_ls of the enemy.

11. H_ving _onverted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies _nd using them for our own purposes.

12. H_ving doomed spies, doing _ert_in things openly for purposes of de_eption, _nd _llowing our spies to know of them _nd report them to the enemy.

13. Surviving spies, fin_lly, _re those who _ring ___k news from the enemy's __mp.

14-1. Hen_e it is th_t whi_h none in the whole _rmy _re more intim_te rel_tions to _e m_int_ined th_n with spies.

14-2. None should _e more li_er_lly rew_rded.

14-3. In no other _usiness should gre_ter se_re_y _e preserved.

15. Spies __nnot _e usefully employed without _ _ert_in intuitive s_g__ity.

16. They __nnot _e properly m_n_ged without _enevolen_e _nd str_ightforw_rdness.

17. Without su_tle ingenuity of mind, one __nnot m_ke _ert_in of the truth of their reports.

18. _e su_tle! _e su_tle! _nd use your spies for every kind of _usiness.

19. If _ se_ret pie_e of news is divulged _y _ spy _efore the time is ripe, he must _e put to de_th together with the m_n to whom the se_ret w_s told.

20-2. Our spies must _e _ommissioned to _s_ert_in these.

21-1. The enemy's spies who h_ve _ome to spy on us must _e sought out, tempted with _ri_es, led _w_y _nd _omfort__ly housed.

21-2. Thus they will _e_ome _onverted spies _nd _v_il__le for our servi_e.

22. It is through the inform_tion _rought _y the _onverted spy th_t we _re __le to __quire _nd employ lo__l _nd inw_rd spies.

23. It is owing to his inform_tion, _g_in, th_t we __n __use the doomed spy to __rry f_lse tidings to the enemy.

24. L_stly, it is _y his inform_tion th_t the surviving spy __n _e used on _ppointed o___sions.

25-1. The end _nd _im of spying in _ll its five v_rieties is knowledge of the enemy; _nd this knowledge __n only _e derived, in the first inst_n_e, from the _onverted spy.

25-2. Hen_e it is essenti_l th_t the _onverted spy _e tre_ted with the utmost li_er_lity.
