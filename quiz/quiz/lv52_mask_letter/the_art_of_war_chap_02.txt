II. W_GING W_R


1-1. Sun Tzu s_id: In the oper_tions of w_r, where there _re in the field _ thous_nd swift _h_riots, _s m_ny he_vy _h_riots, _nd _ hundred thous_nd m_il-_l_d soldiers, with provisions enough to __rry them _ thous_nd li, the expenditure _t home _nd _t the front, in_luding entert_inment of guests, sm_ll items su_h _s glue _nd p_int, _nd sums spent on _h_riots _nd _rmor, will re__h the tot_l of _ thous_nd oun_es of silver per d_y.


1-2. Su_h is the _ost of r_ising _n _rmy of 100,000 men.


2-1. When you eng_ge in __tu_l fighting, if vi_tory is long in _oming, then men's we_pons will grow dull _nd their _rdor will _e d_mped.


2-2. If you l_y siege to _ town, you will exh_ust your strength.


3. _g_in, if the __mp_ign is protr__ted, the resour_es of the St_te will not _e equ_l to the str_in.


4-1. Now, when your we_pons _re dulled, your _rdor d_mped, your strength exh_usted _nd your tre_sure spent, other _hieft_ins will spring up to t_ke _dv_nt_ge of your extremity.


4-2. Then no m_n, however wise, will _e __le to _vert the _onsequen_es th_t must ensue.


5. Thus, though we h_ve he_rd of stupid h_ste in w_r, _leverness h_s never _een seen _sso_i_ted with long del_ys.


6. There is no inst_n_e of _ _ountry h_ving _enefited from prolonged w_rf_re.


7. It is only one who is thoroughly __qu_inted with the evils of w_r th_t __n thoroughly underst_nd the profit__le w_y of __rrying it on.


8. The skillful soldier does not r_ise _ se_ond levy, neither _re his supply-w_gons lo_ded more th_n twi_e.


9-1. _ring w_r m_teri_l with you from home, _ut for_ge on the enemy.


9-2. Thus the _rmy will h_ve food enough for its needs.


10-1. Poverty of the St_te ex_hequer __uses _n _rmy to _e m_int_ined _y _ontri_utions from _ dist_n_e.


10-2. _ontri_uting to m_int_in _n _rmy _t _ dist_n_e __uses the people to _e impoverished.


11. On the other h_nd, the proximity of _n _rmy __uses pri_es to go up; _nd high pri_es __use the people's su_st_n_e to _e dr_ined _w_y.


12. When their su_st_n_e is dr_ined _w_y, the pe_s_ntry will _e _ffli_ted _y he_vy ex__tions.


13,14. With this loss of su_st_n_e _nd exh_ustion of strength, the homes of the people will _e stripped __re, _nd three-tenths of their in_ome will _e dissip_ted; while government expenses for _roken _h_riots, worn-out horses, _re_st-pl_tes _nd helmets, _ows _nd _rrows, spe_rs _nd shields, prote_tive m_ntles, dr_ught-oxen _nd he_vy w_gons, will _mount to four-tenths of its tot_l revenue.


15-1. Hen_e _ wise gener_l m_kes _ point of for_ging on the enemy.


15-2. One __rtlo_d of the enemy's provisions is equiv_lent to twenty of one's own, _nd likewise _ single pi_ul of his provender is equiv_lent to twenty from one's own store.


16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must _e roused to _nger; th_t there m_y _e _dv_nt_ge from defe_ting the enemy, they must h_ve their rew_rds.


17-1. Therefore in _h_riot fighting, when ten or more _h_riots h_ve _een t_ken, those should _e rew_rded who took the first.


17-2. Our own fl_gs should _e su_stituted for those of the enemy, _nd the _h_riots mingled _nd used in _onjun_tion with ours.


17-3. The __ptured soldiers should _e kindly tre_ted _nd kept.


18. This is __lled, using the _onquered foe to _ugment one's own strength.


19. In w_r, then, let your gre_t o_je_t _e vi_tory, not lengthy __mp_igns.


20. Thus it m_y _e known th_t the le_der of _rmies is the _r_iter of the people's f_te, the m_n on whom it depends whether the n_tion sh_ll _e in pe__e or in peril.
