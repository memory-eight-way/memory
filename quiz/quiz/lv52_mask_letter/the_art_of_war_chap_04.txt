IV. T__TI__L DISPOSITIONS


1. Sun Tzu s_id: The good fighters of old first put themselves _eyond the possi_ility of defe_t, _nd then w_ited for _n opportunity of defe_ting the enemy.


2. To se_ure ourselves _g_inst defe_t lies in our own h_nds, _ut the opportunity of defe_ting the enemy is provided _y the enemy himself.


3. Thus the good fighter is __le to se_ure himself _g_inst defe_t, _ut __nnot m_ke _ert_in of defe_ting the enemy.


4. Hen_e the s_ying: One m_y know how to _onquer without _eing __le to do it.


5. Se_urity _g_inst defe_t implies defensive t__ti_s; __ility to defe_t the enemy me_ns t_king the offensive.


6. St_nding on the defensive indi__tes insuffi_ient strength; _tt__king, _ super__und_n_e of strength.


7-1. The gener_l who is skilled in defense hides in the most se_ret re_esses of the e_rth; he who is skilled in _tt__k fl_shes forth from the topmost heights of he_ven.


7-2. Thus on the one h_nd we h_ve __ility to prote_t ourselves; on the other, _ vi_tory th_t is _omplete.


8. To see vi_tory only when it is within the ken of the _ommon herd is not the __me of ex_ellen_e.


9. Neither is it the __me of ex_ellen_e if you fight _nd _onquer _nd the whole Empire s_ys, "Well done!"


10. To lift _n _utumn h_ir is no sign of gre_t strength; to see the sun _nd moon is no sign of sh_rp sight; to he_r the noise of thunder is no sign of _ qui_k e_r.


11. Wh_t the _n_ients __lled _ _lever fighter is one who not only wins, _ut ex_els in winning with e_se.


12. Hen_e his vi_tories _ring him neither reput_tion for wisdom nor _redit for _our_ge.


13-1. He wins his __ttles _y m_king no mist_kes.


13-2. M_king no mist_kes is wh_t est__lishes the _ert_inty of vi_tory, for it me_ns _onquering _n enemy th_t is _lre_dy defe_ted.


14. Hen_e the skillful fighter puts himself into _ position whi_h m_kes defe_t impossi_le, _nd does not miss the moment for defe_ting the enemy.


15. Thus it is th_t in w_r the vi_torious str_tegist only seeks __ttle _fter the vi_tory h_s _een won, where_s he who is destined to defe_t first fights _nd _fterw_rds looks for vi_tory.


16. The _onsumm_te le_der _ultiv_tes the mor_l l_w, _nd stri_tly _dheres to method _nd dis_ipline; thus it is in his power to _ontrol su__ess.


17. In respe_t of milit_ry method, we h_ve, firstly, Me_surement; se_ondly, Estim_tion of qu_ntity; thirdly, __l_ul_tion; fourthly, __l_n_ing of _h_n_es; fifthly, Vi_tory.


18. Me_surement owes its existen_e to E_rth; Estim_tion of qu_ntity to Me_surement; __l_ul_tion to Estim_tion of qu_ntity; __l_n_ing of _h_n_es to __l_ul_tion; _nd Vi_tory to __l_n_ing of _h_n_es.


19. _ vi_torious _rmy opposed to _ routed one, is _s _ pound's weight pl__ed in the s__le _g_inst _ single gr_in.


20. The onrush of _ _onquering for_e is like the _ursting of pent-up w_ters into _ _h_sm _ thous_nd f_thoms deep.
