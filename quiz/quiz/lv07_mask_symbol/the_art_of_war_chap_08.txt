VIII. VARIATION IN TACTICS


1. Sun Tzu said_ In war_ the general receives his commands from the sovereign_ collects his army and concentrates his forces_


2-1. When in difficult country_ do not encamp_


2-2. In country where high roads intersect_ join hands with your allies_


2-3. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions_


2-4. In hemmed_in situations_ you must resort to stratagem_


2-5. In desperate position_ you must fight_


3. There are roads which must not be followed_ armies which must be not attacked_ towns which must not be besieged_ positions which must not be contested_ commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed_


4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops_


5. The general who does not understand these_ may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country_ yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account_


6. So_ the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans_ even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages_ will fail to make the best use of his men_


7. Hence in the wise leader_s plans_ considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together_


8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way_ we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes_


9. If_ on the other hand_ in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage_ we may extricate ourselves from misfortune_


10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them_ and make trouble for them_ and keep them constantly engaged_ hold out specious allurements_ and make them rush to any given point_


11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy_s not coming_ but on our own readiness to receive him_ not on the chance of his not attacking_ but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable_


12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general_ _1_ Recklessness_ which leads to destruction_ _2_ cowardice_ which leads to capture_ _3_ a hasty temper_ which can be provoked by insults_ _4_ a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame_ _5_ over_solicitude for his men_ which exposes him to worry and trouble_


13. These are the five besetting sins of a general_ ruinous to the conduct of war_


14-1. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain_ the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults_


14-2. Let them be a subject of meditation_
