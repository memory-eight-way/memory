III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM

1-1. Sun Tzu said_ In the practical art of war_ the best thing of all is to take the enemy_s country whole and intact_ to shatter and destroy it is not so good_

1-2. So_ too_ it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it_ to capture a regiment_ a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them_

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence_ supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy_s resistance without fighting_

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy_s plans_ the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy_s forces_ the next in order is to attack the enemy_s army in the field_ and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities_

4-1. The rule is_ not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided_

4-2. The preparation of mantlets_ movable shelters_ and various implements of war_ will take up three whole months_ and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more_

5-1. The general_ unable to control his irritation_ will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants_ with the result that one_third of his men are slain_ while the town still remains untaken_

5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege_

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy_s troops without any fighting_ he captures their cities without laying siege to them_ he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field_

7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire_ and thus_ without losing a man_ his triumph will be complete_

7-2. This is the method of attacking by stratagem_

8. It is the rule in war_ if our forces are ten to the enemy_s one_ to surround him_ if five to one_ to attack him_ if twice as numerous_ to divide our army into two_

9. If equally matched_ we can offer battle_ if slightly inferior in numbers_ we can avoid the enemy_ if quite unequal in every way_ we can flee from him_

10. Hence_ though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force_ in the end it must be captured by the larger force_

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State_ if the bulwark is complete at all points_ the State will be strong_ if the bulwark is defective_ the State will be weak_

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army___

13-1. _1_ By commanding the army to advance or to retreat_ being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey_

13-2. This is called hobbling the army_

14-1. _2_ By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom_ being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army_

14-2. This causes restlessness in the soldier_s minds_

15-1. _3_ By employing the officers of his army without discrimination_ through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances_

15-2. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers_

16-1. But when the army is restless and distrustful_ trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes_

16-2. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army_ and flinging victory away_

17-1. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory_ _1_ He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight_

17-2. _2_ He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces_

17-3. _3_ He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks_

17-4. _4_ He will win who_ prepared himself_ waits to take the enemy unprepared_

17-5. _5_ He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign_

18-1. Hence the saying_ If you know the enemy and know yourself_ you need not fear the result of a hundred battles_

18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy_ for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat_

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself_ you will succumb in every battle_
