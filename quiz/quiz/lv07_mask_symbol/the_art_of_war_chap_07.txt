VII. MANEUVERING

1. Sun Tzu said_ In war_ the general receives his commands from the sovereign_

2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces_ he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp_

3-1. After that_ comes tactical maneuvering_ than which there is nothing more difficult_

3-2. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct_ and misfortune into gain_

4. Thus_ to take a long and circuitous route_ after enticing the enemy out of the way_ and though starting after him_ to contrive to reach the goal before him_ shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION_

5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous_ with an undisciplined multitude_ most dangerous_

6-1. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage_ the chances are that you will be too late_

6-2. On the other hand_ to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores_

7. Thus_ if you order your men to roll up their buff_coats_ and make forced marches without halting day or night_ covering double the usual distance at a stretch_ doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage_ the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy_

8. The stronger men will be in front_ the jaded ones will fall behind_ and on this plan only one_tenth of your army will reach its destination_

9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy_ you will lose the leader of your first division_ and only half your force will reach the goal_

10. If you march thirty LI with the same object_ two_thirds of your army will arrive_

11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage_train is lost_ without provisions it is lost_ without bases of supply it is lost_

12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors_

13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country__ its mountains and forests_ its pitfalls and precipices_ its marshes and swamps_

14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides_

15. In war_ practice dissimulation_ and you will succeed_

16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops_ must be decided by circumstances_

17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind_ your compactness that of the forest_

18. In raiding and plundering be like fire_ in immovability like a mountain_

19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night_ and when you move_ fall like a thunderbolt_

20. When you plunder a countryside_ let the spoil be divided amongst your men_ when you capture new territory_ cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery_

21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move_

22-1. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation_

22-2. Such is the art of maneuvering_

23-1. The Book of Army Management says_ On the field of battle_ the spoken word does not carry far enough_ hence the institution of gongs and drums_

23-2. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough_ hence the institution of banners and flags_

24. Gongs and drums_ banners and flags_ are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point_

25-1. The host thus forming a single united body_ is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone_ or for the cowardly to retreat alone_

25-2. This is the art of handling large masses of men_

26. In night_fighting_ then_ make much use of signal_fires and drums_ and in fighting by day_ of flags and banners_ as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army_

27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit_ a commander_in_chief may be robbed of his presence of mind_

28. Now a soldier_s spirit is keenest in the morning_ by noonday it has begun to flag_ and in the evening_ his mind is bent only on returning to camp_

29-1. A clever general_ therefore_ avoids an army when its spirit is keen_ but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return_

29-2. This is the art of studying moods_

30. Disciplined and calm_ to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy___ this is the art of retaining self_possession_

31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it_ to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling_ to be well_fed while the enemy is famished___ this is the art of husbanding one_s strength_

32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order_ to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array___ this is the art of studying circumstances_

33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy_ nor to oppose him when he comes downhill_

34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight_ do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen_

35-1. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy_

35-2. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home_

36-1. When you surround an army_ leave an outlet free_

36-2. Do not press a desperate foe too hard_

37. Such is the art of warfare_
