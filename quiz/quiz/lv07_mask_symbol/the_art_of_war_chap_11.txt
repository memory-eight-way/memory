XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS

1. Sun Tzu said_ The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground_ _1_ Dispersive ground_ _2_ facile ground_ _3_ contentious ground_ _4_ open ground_ _5_ ground of intersecting highways_ _6_ serious ground_ _7_ difficult ground_ _8_ hemmed_in ground_ _9_ desperate ground_

2. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory_ it is dispersive ground_

3. When he has penetrated into hostile territory_ but to no great distance_ it is facile ground_

4. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side_ is contentious ground_

5. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground_

6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states_ so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command_ is a ground of intersecting highways_

7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country_ leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear_ it is serious ground_

8. Mountain forests_ rugged steeps_ marshes and fens__ all country that is hard to traverse_ this is difficult ground_

9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges_ and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths_ so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men_ this is hemmed in ground_

10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay_ is desperate ground_

11-1. On dispersive ground_ therefore_ fight not_

11-2. On facile ground_ halt not_

11-3. On contentious ground_ attack not_

12-1. On open ground_ do not try to block the enemy_s way_

12-2. On the ground of intersecting highways_ join hands with your allies_

13-1. On serious ground_ gather in plunder_

13-2. In difficult ground_ keep steadily on the march_

14-1. On hemmed_in ground_ resort to stratagem_

14-2. On desperate ground_ fight_

15. Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy_s front and rear_ to prevent co_operation between his large and small divisions_ to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad_ the officers from rallying their men_

16. When the enemy_s men were united_ they managed to keep them in disorder_

17. When it was to their advantage_ they made a forward move_ when otherwise_ they stopped still_

18. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack_ I should say_ _Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear_ then he will be amenable to your will__

19. Rapidity is the essence of war_ take advantage of the enemy_s unreadiness_ make your way by unexpected routes_ and attack unguarded spots_

20. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force_ The further you penetrate into a country_ the greater will be the solidarity of your troops_ and thus the defenders will not prevail against you_

21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food_

22-1. Carefully study the well_being of your men_ and do not overtax them_

22-2. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength_

22-3. Keep your army continually on the move_ and devise unfathomable plans_

23-1. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape_ and they will prefer death to flight_

23-2. If they will face death_ there is nothing they may not achieve_

23-3. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength_

24-1. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear_

24-2. If there is no place of refuge_ they will stand firm_

24-3. If they are in hostile country_ they will show a stubborn front_

24-4. If there is no help for it_ they will fight hard_

25. Thus_ without waiting to be marshaled_ the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive_ without waiting to be asked_ they will do your will_ without restrictions_ they will be faithful_ without giving orders_ they can be trusted_

26-1. Prohibit the taking of omens_ and do away with superstitious doubts_

26-2. Then_ until death itself comes_ no calamity need be feared_

27. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money_ it is not because they have a distaste for riches_ if their lives are not unduly long_ it is not because they are disinclined to longevity_

28-1. On the day they are ordered out to battle_ your soldiers may weep_ those sitting up bedewing their garments_ and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks_

28-2. But let them once be brought to bay_ and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei_

29-1. The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai_jan_

29-2. Now the shuai_jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains_

29-3. Strike at its head_ and you will be attacked by its tail_ strike at its tail_ and you will be attacked by its head_ strike at its middle_ and you will be attacked by head and tail both_

30-1. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai_jan_ I should answer_ Yes_

30-2. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies_ yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm_ they will come to each other_s assistance just as the left hand helps the right_

31. Hence it is not enough to put one_s trust in the tethering of horses_ and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground_

32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach_

33. How to make the best of both strong and weak__ that is a question involving the proper use of ground_

34. Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man_ willy_nilly_ by the hand_

35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy_ upright and just_ and thus maintain order_

36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances_ and thus keep them in total ignorance_

37-1. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans_ he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge_

37-2. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes_ he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose_

38-1. At the critical moment_ the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him_

38-2. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand_

39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking_pots_ like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep_ he drives his men this way and that_ and nothing knows whither he is going_

40. To muster his host and bring it into danger___ this may be termed the business of the general_

41. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground_ the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics_ and the fundamental laws of human nature_ these are things that must most certainly be studied_

42. When invading hostile territory_ the general principle is_ that penetrating deeply brings cohesion_ penetrating but a short way means dispersion_

43-1. When you leave your own country behind_ and take your army across neighborhood territory_ you find yourself on critical ground_

43-2. When there are means of communication on all four sides_ the ground is one of intersecting highways_

44-1. When you penetrate deeply into a country_ it is serious ground_

44-2. When you penetrate but a little way_ it is facile ground_

45-1. When you have the enemy_s strongholds on your rear_ and narrow passes in front_ it is hemmed_in ground_

45-2. When there is no place of refuge at all_ it is desperate ground_

46-1. Therefore_ on dispersive ground_ I would inspire my men with unity of purpose_

46-2. On facile ground_ I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army_

47. On contentious ground_ I would hurry up my rear_

48-1. On open ground_ I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses_

48-2. On ground of intersecting highways_ I would consolidate my alliances_

49-1. On serious ground_ I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies_

50-1. On hemmed_in ground_ I would block any way of retreat_

50-2. On desperate ground_ I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives_

51. For it is the soldier_s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded_ to fight hard when he cannot help himself_ and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger_

52-1. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs_

52-2. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country__ its mountains and forests_ its pitfalls and precipices_ its marshes and swamps_

52-3. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides_

53. To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince_

54-1. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state_ his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy_s forces_

54-2. He overawes his opponents_ and their allies are prevented from joining against him_

55-1. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry_ nor does he foster the power of other states_

55-2. He carries out his own secret designs_ keeping his antagonists in awe_

55-3. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms_

56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule_ issue orders without regard to previous arrangements_ and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man_

57-1. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself_ never let them know your design_

57-2. When the outlook is bright_ bring it before their eyes_ but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy_

58. Place your army in deadly peril_ and it will survive_ plunge it into desperate straits_ and it will come off in safety_

59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm_s way that is capable of striking a blow for victory_

60. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy_s purpose_

61. By persistently hanging on the enemy_s flank_ we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander_in_chief_

62. This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning_
