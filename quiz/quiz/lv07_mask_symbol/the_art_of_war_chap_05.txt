V. ENERGY


1. Sun Tzu said_ The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men_ it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers_


2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one_ it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals_


3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy_s attack and remain unshaken__ this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect_


4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg__ this is effected by the science of weak points and strong_


5. In all fighting_ the direct method may be used for joining battle_ but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory_


6. Indirect tactics_ efficiently applied_ are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth_ unending as the flow of rivers and streams_ like the sun and moon_ they end but to begin anew_ like the four seasons_ they pass away to return once more_


7. There are not more than five musical notes_ yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard_


8. There are not more than five primary colors _blue_ yellow_ red_ white_ and black__ yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen_


9. There are not more than five cardinal tastes _sour_ acrid_ salt_ sweet_ bitter__ yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted_


10. In battle_ there are not more than two methods of attack__ the direct and the indirect_ yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers_


11-1. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn_


11-2. It is like moving in a circle__ you never come to an end_


11-3. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination_


12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course_


13. The quality of decision is like the well_timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim_


14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset_ and prompt in his decision_


15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow_ decision_ to the releasing of a trigger_


16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle_ there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all_ amid confusion and chaos_ your array may be without head or tail_ yet it will be proof against defeat_


17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline_ simulated fear postulates courage_ simulated weakness postulates strength_


18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision_ concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy_ masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions_


19-1. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances_ according to which the enemy will act_


19-2. He sacrifices something_ that the enemy may snatch at it_


20. By holding out baits_ he keeps him on the march_ then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him_


21-1. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy_ and does not require too much from individuals_


21-2. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy_


22-1. When he utilizes combined energy_ his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones_


22-2. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground_ and to move when on a slope_ if four_cornered_ to come to a standstill_ but if round_shaped_ to go rolling down_


23-1. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height_


23-2. So much on the subject of energy_
