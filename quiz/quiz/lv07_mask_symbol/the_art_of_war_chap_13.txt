XIII. THE USE OF SPIES

1-1. Sun Tzu said_ Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State_

1-2. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver_

1-3. There will be commotion at home and abroad_ and men will drop down exhausted on the highways_

1-4. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor_

2-1. Hostile armies may face each other for years_ striving for the victory which is decided in a single day_

2-2. This being so_ to remain in ignorance of the enemy_s condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments_ is the height of inhumanity_

3. One who acts thus is no leader of men_ no present help to his sovereign_ no master of victory_

4. Thus_ what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer_ and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men_ is foreknowledge_

5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits_ it cannot be obtained inductively from experience_ nor by any deductive calculation_

6. Knowledge of the enemy_s dispositions can only be obtained from other men_

7. Hence the use of spies_ of whom there are five classes_ _1_ Local spies_ _2_ inward spies_ _3_ converted spies_ _4_ doomed spies_ _5_ surviving spies_

8-1. When these five kinds of spy are all at work_ none can discover the secret system_

8-2. This is called _divine manipulation of the threads__

8-3. It is the sovereign_s most precious faculty_

9. Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district_

10. Having inward spies_ making use of officials of the enemy_

11. Having converted spies_ getting hold of the enemy_s spies and using them for our own purposes_

12. Having doomed spies_ doing certain things openly for purposes of deception_ and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy_

13. Surviving spies_ finally_ are those who bring back news from the enemy_s camp_

14-1. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies_

14-2. None should be more liberally rewarded_

14-3. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved_

15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity_

16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness_

17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind_ one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports_

18. Be subtle_ be subtle_ and use your spies for every kind of business_

19. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe_ he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told_

20-1. Whether the object be to crush an army_ to storm a city_ or to assassinate an individual_ it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants_ the aides_de_camp_ and door_keepers and sentries of the general in command_

20-2. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these_

21-1. The enemy_s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out_ tempted with bribes_ led away and comfortably housed_

21-2. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service_

22. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies_

23. It is owing to his information_ again_ that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy_

24. Lastly_ it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions_

25-1. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy_ and this knowledge can only be derived_ in the first instance_ from the converted spy_

25-2. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality_

26-1. Of old_ the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia_

26-2. Likewise_ the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin_

27-1. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results_

27-2. Spies are a most important element in water_ because on them depends an army_s ability to move_
