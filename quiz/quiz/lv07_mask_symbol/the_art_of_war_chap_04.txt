Lv7
IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS


1. Sun Tzu said_ The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat_ and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy_


2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands_ but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself_


3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat_ but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy_


4. Hence the saying_ One may know how to conquer without being able to do it_


5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics_ ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive_


6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength_ attacking_ a superabundance of strength_


7-1. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth_ he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven_


7-2. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves_ on the other_ a victory that is complete_


8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence_


9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says_ _Well done__


10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength_ to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight_ to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear_


11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins_ but excels in winning with ease_


12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage_


13-1. He wins his battles by making no mistakes_


13-2. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory_ for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated_


14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible_ and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy_


15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won_ whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory_


16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law_ and strictly adheres to method and discipline_ thus it is in his power to control success_


17. In respect of military method_ we have_ firstly_ Measurement_ secondly_ Estimation of quantity_ thirdly_ Calculation_ fourthly_ Balancing of chances_ fifthly_ Victory_


18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth_ Estimation of quantity to Measurement_ Calculation to Estimation of quantity_ Balancing of chances to Calculation_ and Victory to Balancing of chances_


19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one_ is as a pound_s weight placed in the scale against a single grain_


20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent_up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep_
