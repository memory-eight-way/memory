X. TERRAIN

1. Sun Tzu said_ We may distinguish six kinds of terrain_ to wit_ _1_ Accessible ground_ _2_ entangling ground_ _3_ temporizing ground_ _4_ narrow passes_ _5_ precipitous heights_ _6_ positions at a great distance from the enemy_

2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible_

3-1. With regard to ground of this nature_ be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots_ and carefully guard your line of supplies_

3-2. Then you will be able to fight with advantage_

4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re_occupy is called entangling_

5-1. From a position of this sort_ if the enemy is unprepared_ you may sally forth and defeat him_

5-2. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming_ and you fail to defeat him_ then_ return being impossible_ disaster will ensue_

6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move_ it is called temporizing ground_

7. In a position of this sort_ even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait_ it will be advisable not to stir forth_ but rather to retreat_ thus enticing the enemy in his turn_ then_ when part of his army has come out_ we may deliver our attack with advantage_

8. With regard to narrow passes_ if you can occupy them first_ let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy_

9. Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass_ do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned_ but only if it is weakly garrisoned_

10. With regard to precipitous heights_ if you are beforehand with your adversary_ you should occupy the raised and sunny spots_ and there wait for him to come up_

11. If the enemy has occupied them before you_ do not follow him_ but retreat and try to entice him away_

12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy_ and the strength of the two armies is equal_ it is not easy to provoke a battle_ and fighting will be to your disadvantage_

13-1. These six are the principles connected with Earth_

13-2. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them_

14-1. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities_ not arising from natural causes_ but from faults for which the general is responsible_

14-2. These are_ _1_ Flight_ _2_ insubordination_ _3_ collapse_ _4_ ruin_ _5_ disorganization_ _6_ rout_

15. Other conditions being equal_ if one force is hurled against another ten times its size_ the result will be the flight of the former_

16-1. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak_ the result is insubordination_

16-2. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak_ the result is collapse_

17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate_ and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment_ before the commander_in_chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight_ the result is ruin_

18. When the general is weak and without authority_ when his orders are not clear and distinct_ when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men_ and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner_ the result is utter disorganization_

19. When a general_ unable to estimate the enemy_s strength_ allows an inferior force to engage a larger one_ or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one_ and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank_ the result must be rout_

20. These are six ways of courting defeat_ which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post_

21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier_s best ally_ but a power of estimating the adversary_ of controlling the forces of victory_ and of shrewdly calculating difficulties_ dangers and distances_ constitutes the test of a great general_

22-1. He who knows these things_ and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice_ will win his battles_

22-2. He who knows them not_ nor practices them_ will surely be defeated_

23. If fighting is sure to result in victory_ then you must fight_ even though the ruler forbid it_ if fighting will not result in victory_ then you must not fight even at the ruler_s bidding_

24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace_ whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign_ is the jewel of the kingdom_

25. Regard your soldiers as your children_ and they will follow you into the deepest valleys_ look upon them as your own beloved sons_ and they will stand by you even unto death_

26. If_ however_ you are indulgent_ but unable to make your authority felt_ kind_hearted_ but unable to enforce your commands_ and incapable_ moreover_ of quelling disorder_ then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children_ they are useless for any practical purpose_

27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack_ but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack_ we have gone only halfway towards victory_

28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack_ but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack_ we have gone only halfway towards victory_

29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack_ and also know that our men are in a condition to attack_ but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable_ we have still gone only halfway towards victory_

30. Hence the experienced soldier_ once in motion_ is never bewildered_ once he has broken camp_ he is never at a loss_

31. Hence the saying_ If you know the enemy and know yourself_ your victory will not stand in doubt_ if you know Heaven and know Earth_ you may make your victory complete_
