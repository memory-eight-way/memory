XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE

1-1. Sun Tzu said_ There are five ways of attacking with fire_

1-2. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp_ the second is to burn stores_ the third is to burn baggage trains_ the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines_ the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy_

2-1. In order to carry out an attack_ we must have means available_

2-2. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness_

3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire_ and special days for starting a conflagration_

4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry_ the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve_ the Wall_ the Wing or the Cross_bar_ for these four are all days of rising wind_

5-1. In attacking with fire_ one should be prepared to meet five possible developments_ 6_

5-2. _1_ When fire breaks out inside to enemy_s camp_ respond at once with an attack from without_

7. _2_ If there is an outbreak of fire_ but the enemy_s soldiers remain quiet_ bide your time and do not attack_

8. _3_ When the force of the flames has reached its height_ follow it up with an attack_ if that is practicable_ if not_ stay where you are_

9. _4_ If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without_ do not wait for it to break out within_ but deliver your attack at a favorable moment_

10-1. _5_ When you start a fire_ be to windward of it_

10-2. Do not attack from the leeward_

11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long_ but a night breeze soon falls_

12. In every army_ the five developments connected with fire must be known_ the movements of the stars calculated_ and a watch kept for the proper days_

13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence_ those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength_

14. By means of water_ an enemy may be intercepted_ but not robbed of all his belongings_

15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise_ for the result is waste of time and general stagnation_

16. Hence the saying_ The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead_ the good general cultivates his resources_

17. Move not unless you see an advantage_ use not your troops unless there is something to be gained_ fight not unless the position is critical_

18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen_ no general should fight a battle simply out of pique_

19. If it is to your advantage_ make a forward move_ if not_ stay where you are_

20. Anger may in time change to gladness_ vexation may be succeeded by content_

21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being_ nor can the dead ever be brought back to life_

22-1. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful_ and the good general full of caution_

22-2. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact_
