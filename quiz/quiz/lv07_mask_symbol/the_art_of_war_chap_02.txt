II. WAGING WAR

1-1. Sun Tzu said_ In the operations of war_ where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots_ as many heavy chariots_ and a hundred thousand mail_clad soldiers_ with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li_ the expenditure at home and at the front_ including entertainment of guests_ small items such as glue and paint_ and sums spent on chariots and armor_ will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day_

1-2. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100_000 men_

2-1. When you engage in actual fighting_ if victory is long in coming_ then men_s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped_

2-2. If you lay siege to a town_ you will exhaust your strength_

3. Again_ if the campaign is protracted_ the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain_

4-1. Now_ when your weapons are dulled_ your ardor damped_ your strength exhausted and your treasure spent_ other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity_

4-2. Then no man_ however wise_ will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue_

5. Thus_ though we have heard of stupid haste in war_ cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays_

6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare_

7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on_

8. The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy_ neither are his supply_wagons loaded more than twice_

9-1. Bring war material with you from home_ but forage on the enemy_

9-2. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs_

10-1. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance_

10-2. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished_

11. On the other hand_ the proximity of an army causes prices to go up_ and high prices cause the people_s substance to be drained away_

12. When their substance is drained away_ the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions_

13,14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength_ the homes of the people will be stripped bare_ and three_tenths of their income will be dissipated_ while government expenses for broken chariots_ worn_out horses_ breast_plates and helmets_ bows and arrows_ spears and shields_ protective mantles_ draught_oxen and heavy wagons_ will amount to four_tenths of its total revenue_

15-1. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy_

15-2. One cartload of the enemy_s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one_s own_ and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one_s own store_

16. Now in order to kill the enemy_ our men must be roused to anger_ that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy_ they must have their rewards_

17-1. Therefore in chariot fighting_ when ten or more chariots have been taken_ those should be rewarded who took the first_

17-2. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy_ and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours_

17-3. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept_

18. This is called_ using the conquered foe to augment one_s own strength_

19. In war_ then_ let your great object be victory_ not lengthy campaigns_

20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people_s fate_ the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril_
