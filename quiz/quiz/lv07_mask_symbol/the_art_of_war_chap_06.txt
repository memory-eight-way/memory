VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG




1. Sun Tzu said_ Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy_ will be fresh for the fight_ whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted_


2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy_ but does not allow the enemy_s will to be imposed on him_


3. By holding out advantages to him_ he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord_ or_ by inflicting damage_ he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near_


4. If the enemy is taking his ease_ he can harass him_ if well supplied with food_ he can starve him out_ if quietly encamped_ he can force him to move_


5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend_ march swiftly to places where you are not expected_


6. An army may march great distances without distress_ if it marches through country where the enemy is not_


7-1. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended_


7-2. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked_


8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend_ and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack_


9-1. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy_


9-2. Through you we learn to be invisible_ through you inaudible_ and hence we can hold the enemy_s fate in our hands_


10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible_ if you make for the enemy_s weak points_ you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy_


11-1. If we wish to fight_ the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch_


11-2. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve_


12-1. If we do not wish to fight_ we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground_


12-2. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way_


13. By discovering the enemy_s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves_ we can keep our forces concentrated_ while the enemy_s must be divided_


14-1. We can form a single united body_ while the enemy must split up into fractions_


14-2. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole_ which means that we shall be many to the enemy_s few_


15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one_ our opponents will be in dire straits_


16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known_ for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points_ and his forces being thus distributed in many directions_ the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few_


17-1. For should the enemy strengthen his van_ he will weaken his rear_ should he strengthen his rear_ he will weaken his van_ should he strengthen his left_ he will weaken his right_ should he strengthen his right_ he will weaken his left_


17-2. If he sends reinforcements everywhere_ he will everywhere be weak_


18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks_ numerical strength_ from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us_


19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle_ we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight_


20-1. But if neither time nor place be known_ then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right_ the right equally impotent to succor the left_ the van unable to relieve the rear_ or the rear to support the van_


20-2. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart_ and even the nearest are separated by several LI_


21-1. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number_ that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory_


21-2. I say then that victory can be achieved_


22-1. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers_ we may prevent him from fighting_


22-2. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success_


23-1. Rouse him_ and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity_


23-2. Force him to reveal himself_ so as to find out his vulnerable spots_


24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own_ so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient_


25. In making tactical dispositions_ the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them_ conceal your dispositions_ and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies_ from the machinations of the wisest brains_


26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy_s own tactics__ that is what the multitude cannot comprehend_


27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer_ but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved_
28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory_ but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances_


29. Military tactics are like unto water_ for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards_


30. So in war_ the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak_


31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows_ the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing_


32. Therefore_ just as water retains no constant shape_ so in warfare there are no constant conditions_


33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning_ may be called a heaven_born captain_


34-1. The five elements _water_ fire_ wood_ metal_ earth_ are not always equally predominant_ the four seasons make way for each other in turn_


34-2. There are short days and long_ the moon has its periods of waning and waxing_
