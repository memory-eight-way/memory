1. Sun Tzu s_id: The control of _ l_rge force is the s_me principle _s the control of _ few men: it is merely _ question of dividing up their num_ers.

5. In _ll fighting, the direct method m_y _e used for joining __ttle, _ut indirect methods will _e needed in order to secure victory.

6. Indirect t_ctics, efficiently _pplied, _re inexh_usti_le _s He_ven _nd E_rth, unending _s the flow of rivers _nd stre_ms; like the sun _nd moon, they end _ut to _egin _new; like the four se_sons, they p_ss _w_y to return once more.

10. In __ttle, there _re not more th_n two methods of _tt_ck-- the direct _nd the indirect; yet these two in com_in_tion give rise to _n endless series of m_neuvers.

11-1. The direct _nd the indirect le_d on to e_ch other in turn.

11-2. It is like moving in _ circle-- you never come to _n end.

17. Simul_ted disorder postul_tes perfect discipline, simul_ted fe_r postul_tes cour_ge; simul_ted we_kness postul_tes strength.

18. Hiding order _ene_th the clo_k of disorder is simply _ question of su_division; conce_ling cour_ge under _ show of timidity presupposes _ fund of l_tent energy; m_sking strength with we_kness is to _e effected _y t_ctic_l dispositions.

22-1. When he utilizes com_ined energy, his fighting men _ecome _s it were like unto rolling logs or stones.

22-2. For it is the n_ture of _ log or stone to rem_in motionless on level ground, _nd to move when on _ slope; if four-cornered, to come to _ st_ndstill, _ut if round-sh_ped, to go rolling down.

23-1. Thus the energy developed _y good fighting men is _s the momentum of _ round stone rolled down _ mount_in thous_nds of feet in height.

23-2. So much on the su_ject of energy.
