XIII. THE USE OF SPIES


1-1. Sun Tzu s_id: R_ising _ host of _ hundred thous_nd men _nd m_rching them gre_t dist_nces ent_ils he_vy loss on the people _nd _ dr_in on the resources of the St_te.


1-2. The d_ily expenditure will _mount to _ thous_nd ounces of silver.


1-3. There will _e commotion _t home _nd __ro_d, _nd men will drop down exh_usted on the highw_ys.


1-4. _s m_ny _s seven hundred thous_nd f_milies will _e impeded in their l__or.


2-1. Hostile _rmies m_y f_ce e_ch other for ye_rs, striving for the victory which is decided in _ single d_y.


2-2. This _eing so, to rem_in in ignor_nce of the enemy's condition simply _ec_use one grudges the outl_y of _ hundred ounces of silver in honors _nd emoluments, is the height of inhum_nity.


3. One who _cts thus is no le_der of men, no present help to his sovereign, no m_ster of victory.


4. Thus, wh_t en__les the wise sovereign _nd the good gener_l to strike _nd conquer, _nd _chieve things _eyond the re_ch of ordin_ry men, is foreknowledge.


5. Now this foreknowledge c_nnot _e elicited from spirits; it c_nnot _e o_t_ined inductively from experience, nor _y _ny deductive c_lcul_tion.


6. Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions c_n only _e o_t_ined from other men.


7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there _re five cl_sses: (1) Loc_l spies; (2) inw_rd spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.


8-1. When these five kinds of spy _re _ll _t work, none c_n discover the secret system.


8-2. This is c_lled "divine m_nipul_tion of the thre_ds."


8-3. It is the sovereign's most precious f_culty.


9. H_ving loc_l spies me_ns employing the services of the inh__it_nts of _ district.


10. H_ving inw_rd spies, m_king use of offici_ls of the enemy.


11. H_ving converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies _nd using them for our own purposes.


12. H_ving doomed spies, doing cert_in things openly for purposes of deception, _nd _llowing our spies to know of them _nd report them to the enemy.


13. Surviving spies, fin_lly, _re those who _ring __ck news from the enemy's c_mp.


14-1. Hence it is th_t which none in the whole _rmy _re more intim_te rel_tions to _e m_int_ined th_n with spies.


14-2. None should _e more li_er_lly rew_rded.


14-3. In no other _usiness should gre_ter secrecy _e preserved.


15. Spies c_nnot _e usefully employed without _ cert_in intuitive s_g_city.


16. They c_nnot _e properly m_n_ged without _enevolence _nd str_ightforw_rdness.


17. Without su_tle ingenuity of mind, one c_nnot m_ke cert_in of the truth of their reports.


18. _e su_tle! _e su_tle! _nd use your spies for every kind of _usiness.


19. If _ secret piece of news is divulged _y _ spy _efore the time is ripe, he must _e put to de_th together with the m_n to whom the secret w_s told.


20-1. Whether the o_ject _e to crush _n _rmy, to storm _ city, or to _ss_ssin_te _n individu_l, it is _lw_ys necess_ry to _egin _y finding out the n_mes of the _ttend_nts, the _ides-de-c_mp, _nd door-keepers _nd sentries of the gener_l in comm_nd.


20-2. Our spies must _e commissioned to _scert_in these.


21-1. The enemy's spies who h_ve come to spy on us must _e sought out, tempted with _ri_es, led _w_y _nd comfort__ly housed.


21-2. Thus they will _ecome converted spies _nd _v_il__le for our service.


22. It is through the inform_tion _rought _y the converted spy th_t we _re __le to _cquire _nd employ loc_l _nd inw_rd spies.


23. It is owing to his inform_tion, _g_in, th_t we c_n c_use the doomed spy to c_rry f_lse tidings to the enemy.


24. L_stly, it is _y his inform_tion th_t the surviving spy c_n _e used on _ppointed occ_sions.


25-1. The end _nd _im of spying in _ll its five v_rieties is knowledge of the enemy; _nd this knowledge c_n only _e derived, in the first inst_nce, from the converted spy.


25-2. Hence it is essenti_l th_t the converted spy _e tre_ted with the utmost li_er_lity.


26-1. Of old, the rise of the Yin dyn_sty w_s due to I Chih who h_d served under the Hsi_.


26-2. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dyn_sty w_s due to Lu Y_ who h_d served under the Yin.


27-1. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler _nd the wise gener_l who will use the highest intelligence of the _rmy for purposes of spying _nd there_y they _chieve gre_t results.


27-2. Spies _re _ most import_nt element in w_ter, _ec_use on them depends _n _rmy's __ility to move.
