I. L_YING PL_NS


1. Sun Tzu s_id: The _rt of w_r is of vit_l import_nce to the St_te.


2-1. It is _ m_tter of life _nd de_th, _ ro_d either to s_fety or to ruin.


2-2. Hence it is _ su_ject of inquiry which c_n on no _ccount _e neglected.


3. The _rt of w_r, then, is governed _y five const_nt f_ctors, to _e t_ken into _ccount in one's deli_er_tions, when seeking to determine the conditions o_t_ining in the field.


4. These _re: (1) The Mor_l L_w; (2) He_ven; (3) E_rth; (4) The Comm_nder; (5) Method _nd discipline.


5,6. The Mor_l L_w c_uses the people to _e in complete _ccord with their ruler, so th_t they will follow him reg_rdless of their lives, undism_yed _y _ny d_nger.


7. He_ven signifies night _nd d_y, cold _nd he_t, times _nd se_sons.


8. E_rth comprises dist_nces, gre_t _nd sm_ll; d_nger _nd security; open ground _nd n_rrow p_sses; the ch_nces of life _nd de_th.


9. The Comm_nder st_nds for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, _enevolence, cour_ge _nd strictness.


10. _y method _nd discipline _re to _e understood the m_rsh_ling of the _rmy in its proper su_divisions, the gr_du_tions of r_nk _mong the officers, the m_inten_nce of ro_ds _y which supplies m_y re_ch the _rmy, _nd the control of milit_ry expenditure.


11. These five he_ds should _e f_mili_r to every gener_l: he who knows them will _e victorious; he who knows them not will f_il.


12. Therefore, in your deli_er_tions, when seeking to determine the milit_ry conditions, let them _e m_de the __sis of _ comp_rison, in this wise:--


13-1. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is im_ued with the Mor_l l_w?


13-2. (2) Which of the two gener_ls h_s most __ility?


13-3. (3) With whom lie the _dv_nt_ges derived from He_ven _nd E_rth?


13-4. (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?


13-5. (5) Which _rmy is stronger?


13-6. (6) On which side _re officers _nd men more highly tr_ined?


13-7. (7) In which _rmy is there the gre_ter const_ncy _oth in rew_rd _nd punishment?


14. _y me_ns of these seven consider_tions I c_n forec_st victory or defe_t.


15-1. The gener_l th_t he_rkens to my counsel _nd _cts upon it, will conquer: let such _ one _e ret_ined in comm_nd!


15-2. The gener_l th_t he_rkens not to my counsel nor _cts upon it, will suffer defe_t:-- let such _ one _e dismissed!


16. While he_ding the profit of my counsel, _v_il yourself _lso of _ny helpful circumst_nces over _nd _eyond the ordin_ry rules.


17. _ccording _s circumst_nces _re f_vor__le, one should modify one's pl_ns.


18. _ll w_rf_re is __sed on deception.


19. Hence, when __le to _tt_ck, we must seem un__le; when using our forces, we must seem in_ctive; when we _re ne_r, we must m_ke the enemy _elieve we _re f_r _w_y; when f_r _w_y, we must m_ke him _elieve we _re ne_r.


20-1. Hold out __its to entice the enemy.


20-2. Feign disorder, _nd crush him.


21-1. If he is secure _t _ll points, _e prep_red for him.


21-2. If he is in superior strength, ev_de him.


22-1. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irrit_te him.


22-2. Pretend to _e we_k, th_t he m_y grow _rrog_nt.


23-1. If he is t_king his e_se, give him no rest.


23-2. If his forces _re united, sep_r_te them.


24. _tt_ck him where he is unprep_red, _ppe_r where you _re not expected.


25. These milit_ry devices, le_ding to victory, must not _e divulged _eforeh_nd.


26-1. Now the gener_l who wins _ __ttle m_kes m_ny c_lcul_tions in his temple ere the __ttle is fought.


26-2. The gener_l who loses _ __ttle m_kes _ut few c_lcul_tions _eforeh_nd.


26-3. Thus do m_ny c_lcul_tions le_d to victory, _nd few c_lcul_tions to defe_t: how much more no c_lcul_tion _t _ll!


26-4. It is _y _ttention to this point th_t I c_n foresee who is likely to win or lose.
