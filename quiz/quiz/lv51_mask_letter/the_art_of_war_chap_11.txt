XI. THE NINE SITU_TIONS


1. Sun Tzu s_id: The _rt of w_r recognizes nine v_rieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) f_cile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highw_ys; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desper_te ground.


2. When _ chieft_in is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.


3. When he h_s penetr_ted into hostile territory, _ut to no gre_t dist_nce, it is f_cile ground.


4. Ground the possession of which imports gre_t _dv_nt_ge to either side, is contentious ground.


5. Ground on which e_ch side h_s li_erty of movement is open ground.


6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous st_tes, so th_t he who occupies it first h_s most of the Empire _t his comm_nd, is _ ground of intersecting highw_ys.


7. When _n _rmy h_s penetr_ted into the he_rt of _ hostile country, le_ving _ num_er of fortified cities in its re_r, it is serious ground.


8. Mount_in forests, rugged steeps, m_rshes _nd fens-- _ll country th_t is h_rd to tr_verse: this is difficult ground.


9. Ground which is re_ched through n_rrow gorges, _nd from which we c_n only retire _y tortuous p_ths, so th_t _ sm_ll num_er of the enemy would suffice to crush _ l_rge _ody of our men: this is hemmed in ground.


10. Ground on which we c_n only _e s_ved from destruction _y fighting without del_y, is desper_te ground.


11-1. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not.


11-2. On f_cile ground, h_lt not.


11-3. On contentious ground, _tt_ck not.


12-1. On open ground, do not try to _lock the enemy's w_y.


12-2. On the ground of intersecting highw_ys, join h_nds with your _llies.


13-1. On serious ground, g_ther in plunder.


13-2. In difficult ground, keep ste_dily on the m_rch.


14-1. On hemmed-in ground, resort to str_t_gem.


14-2. On desper_te ground, fight.


15. Those who were c_lled skillful le_ders of old knew how to drive _ wedge _etween the enemy's front _nd re_r; to prevent co-oper_tion _etween his l_rge _nd sm_ll divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the __d, the officers from r_llying their men.


16. When the enemy's men were united, they m_n_ged to keep them in disorder.


17. When it w_s to their _dv_nt_ge, they m_de _ forw_rd move; when otherwise, they stopped still.


18. If _sked how to cope with _ gre_t host of the enemy in orderly _rr_y _nd on the point of m_rching to the _tt_ck, I should s_y: "_egin _y seizing something which your opponent holds de_r; then he will _e _men__le to your will."


19. R_pidity is the essence of w_r: t_ke _dv_nt_ge of the enemy's unre_diness, m_ke your w_y _y unexpected routes, _nd _tt_ck ungu_rded spots.


20. The following _re the principles to _e o_served _y _n inv_ding force: The further you penetr_te into _ country, the gre_ter will _e the solid_rity of your troops, _nd thus the defenders will not prev_il _g_inst you.


21. M_ke for_ys in fertile country in order to supply your _rmy with food.


22-1. C_refully study the well-_eing of your men, _nd do not overt_x them.


22-2. Concentr_te your energy _nd ho_rd your strength.


22-3. Keep your _rmy continu_lly on the move, _nd devise unf_thom__le pl_ns.


23-1. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no esc_pe, _nd they will prefer de_th to flight.


23-2. If they will f_ce de_th, there is nothing they m_y not _chieve.


23-3. Officers _nd men _like will put forth their uttermost strength.


24-1. Soldiers when in desper_te str_its lose the sense of fe_r.


24-2. If there is no pl_ce of refuge, they will st_nd firm.


24-3. If they _re in hostile country, they will show _ stu__orn front.


24-4. If there is no help for it, they will fight h_rd.


25. Thus, without w_iting to _e m_rsh_led, the soldiers will _e const_ntly on the qui vive; without w_iting to _e _sked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will _e f_ithful; without giving orders, they c_n _e trusted.


26-1. Prohi_it the t_king of omens, _nd do _w_y with superstitious dou_ts.


26-2. Then, until de_th itself comes, no c_l_mity need _e fe_red.


27. If our soldiers _re not over_urdened with money, it is not _ec_use they h_ve _ dist_ste for riches; if their lives _re not unduly long, it is not _ec_use they _re disinclined to longevity.


28-1. On the d_y they _re ordered out to __ttle, your soldiers m_y weep, those sitting up _edewing their g_rments, _nd those lying down letting the te_rs run down their cheeks.


28-2. _ut let them once _e _rought to __y, _nd they will displ_y the cour_ge of _ Chu or _ Kuei.


29-1. The skillful t_ctici_n m_y _e likened to the shu_i-j_n.


29-2. Now the shu_i-j_n is _ sn_ke th_t is found in the ChUng mount_ins.


29-3. Strike _t its he_d, _nd you will _e _tt_cked _y its t_il; strike _t its t_il, _nd you will _e _tt_cked _y its he_d; strike _t its middle, _nd you will _e _tt_cked _y he_d _nd t_il _oth.


30-1. _sked if _n _rmy c_n _e m_de to imit_te the shu_i-j_n, I should _nswer, Yes.


30-2. For the men of Wu _nd the men of Yueh _re enemies; yet if they _re crossing _ river in the s_me _o_t _nd _re c_ught _y _ storm, they will come to e_ch other's _ssist_nce just _s the left h_nd helps the right.


31. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, _nd the _urying of ch_riot wheels in the ground.


32. The principle on which to m_n_ge _n _rmy is to set up one st_nd_rd of cour_ge which _ll must re_ch.


33. How to m_ke the _est of _oth strong _nd we_k-- th_t is _ question involving the proper use of ground.


34. Thus the skillful gener_l conducts his _rmy just _s though he were le_ding _ single m_n, willy-nilly, _y the h_nd.


35. It is the _usiness of _ gener_l to _e quiet _nd thus ensure secrecy; upright _nd just, _nd thus m_int_in order.


36. He must _e __le to mystify his officers _nd men _y f_lse reports _nd _ppe_r_nces, _nd thus keep them in tot_l ignor_nce.


37-1. _y _ltering his _rr_ngements _nd ch_nging his pl_ns, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.


37-2. _y shifting his c_mp _nd t_king circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from _nticip_ting his purpose.


38-1. _t the critic_l moment, the le_der of _n _rmy _cts like one who h_s clim_ed up _ height _nd then kicks _w_y the l_dder _ehind him.


38-2. He c_rries his men deep into hostile territory _efore he shows his h_nd.


39. He _urns his _o_ts _nd _re_ks his cooking-pots; like _ shepherd driving _ flock of sheep, he drives his men this w_y _nd th_t, _nd nothing knows whither he is going.


40. To muster his host _nd _ring it into d_nger:-- this m_y _e termed the _usiness of the gener_l.


41. The different me_sures suited to the nine v_rieties of ground; the expediency of _ggressive or defensive t_ctics; _nd the fund_ment_l l_ws of hum_n n_ture: these _re things th_t must most cert_inly _e studied.


42. When inv_ding hostile territory, the gener_l principle is, th_t penetr_ting deeply _rings cohesion; penetr_ting _ut _ short w_y me_ns dispersion.


43-1. When you le_ve your own country _ehind, _nd t_ke your _rmy _cross neigh_orhood territory, you find yourself on critic_l ground.


43-2. When there _re me_ns of communic_tion on _ll four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highw_ys.


44-1. When you penetr_te deeply into _ country, it is serious ground.


44-2. When you penetr_te _ut _ little w_y, it is f_cile ground.


45-1. When you h_ve the enemy's strongholds on your re_r, _nd n_rrow p_sses in front, it is hemmed-in ground.


45-2. When there is no pl_ce of refuge _t _ll, it is desper_te ground.


46-1. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose.


46-2. On f_cile ground, I would see th_t there is close connection _etween _ll p_rts of my _rmy.


47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my re_r.


48-1. On open ground, I would keep _ vigil_nt eye on my defenses.


48-2. On ground of intersecting highw_ys, I would consolid_te my _lli_nces.


49-1. On serious ground, I would try to ensure _ continuous stre_m of supplies.


49-2. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on _long the ro_d.


50-1. On hemmed-in ground, I would _lock _ny w_y of retre_t.


50-2. On desper_te ground, I would procl_im to my soldiers the hopelessness of s_ving their lives.


51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer _n o_stin_te resist_nce when surrounded, to fight h_rd when he c_nnot help himself, _nd to o_ey promptly when he h_s f_llen into d_nger.


52-1. We c_nnot enter into _lli_nce with neigh_oring princes until we _re _cqu_inted with their designs.


52-2. We _re not fit to le_d _n _rmy on the m_rch unless we _re f_mili_r with the f_ce of the country-- its mount_ins _nd forests, its pitf_lls _nd precipices, its m_rshes _nd sw_mps.


52-3. We sh_ll _e un__le to turn n_tur_l _dv_nt_ges to _ccount unless we m_ke use of loc_l guides.


53. To _e ignored of _ny one of the following four or five principles does not _efit _ w_rlike prince.


54-1. When _ w_rlike prince _tt_cks _ powerful st_te, his gener_lship shows itself in preventing the concentr_tion of the enemy's forces.


54-2. He over_wes his opponents, _nd their _llies _re prevented from joining _g_inst him.


55-1. Hence he does not strive to _lly himself with _ll _nd sundry, nor does he foster the power of other st_tes.


55-2. He c_rries out his own secret designs, keeping his _nt_gonists in _we.


55-3. Thus he is __le to c_pture their cities _nd overthrow their kingdoms.


56. _estow rew_rds without reg_rd to rule, issue orders without reg_rd to previous _rr_ngements; _nd you will _e __le to h_ndle _ whole _rmy _s though you h_d to do with _ut _ single m_n.


57-1. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design.


57-2. When the outlook is _right, _ring it _efore their eyes; _ut tell them nothing when the situ_tion is gloomy.


58. Pl_ce your _rmy in de_dly peril, _nd it will survive; plunge it into desper_te str_its, _nd it will come off in s_fety.


59. For it is precisely when _ force h_s f_llen into h_rm's w_y th_t is c_p__le of striking _ _low for victory.


60. Success in w_rf_re is g_ined _y c_refully _ccommod_ting ourselves to the enemy's purpose.


61. _y persistently h_nging on the enemy's fl_nk, we sh_ll succeed in the long run in killing the comm_nder-in-chief.


62. This is c_lled __ility to _ccomplish _ thing _y sheer cunning.


63. On the d_y th_t you t_ke up your comm_nd, _lock the frontier p_sses, destroy the offici_l t_llies, _nd stop the p_ss_ge of _ll emiss_ries.


64. _e stern in the council-ch_m_er, so th_t you m_y control the situ_tion.


65. If the enemy le_ves _ door open, you must rush in.


66. Forest_ll your opponent _y seizing wh_t he holds de_r, _nd su_tly contrive to time his _rriv_l on the ground.


67. W_lk in the p_th defined _y rule, _nd _ccommod_te yourself to the enemy until you c_n fight _ decisive __ttle.


68. _t first, then, exhi_it the coyness of _ m_iden, until the enemy gives you _n opening; _fterw_rds emul_te the r_pidity of _ running h_re, _nd it will _e too l_te for the enemy to oppose you.
