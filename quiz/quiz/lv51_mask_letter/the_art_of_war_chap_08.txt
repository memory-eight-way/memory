VIII. V_RI_TION IN T_CTICS


1. Sun Tzu s_id: In w_r, the gener_l receives his comm_nds from the sovereign, collects his _rmy _nd concentr_tes his forces.


2-1. When in difficult country, do not enc_mp.


2-2. In country where high ro_ds intersect, join h_nds with your _llies.


2-3. Do not linger in d_ngerously isol_ted positions.


2-4. In hemmed-in situ_tions, you must resort to str_t_gem.


2-5. In desper_te position, you must fight.


3. There _re ro_ds which must not _e followed, _rmies which must _e not _tt_cked, towns which must not _e _esieged, positions which must not _e contested, comm_nds of the sovereign which must not _e o_eyed.


4. The gener_l who thoroughly underst_nds the _dv_nt_ges th_t _ccomp_ny v_ri_tion of t_ctics knows how to h_ndle his troops.


5. The gener_l who does not underst_nd these, m_y _e well _cqu_inted with the configur_tion of the country, yet he will not _e __le to turn his knowledge to pr_ctic_l _ccount.


6. So, the student of w_r who is unversed in the _rt of w_r of v_rying his pl_ns, even though he _e _cqu_inted with the Five _dv_nt_ges, will f_il to m_ke the _est use of his men.


7. Hence in the wise le_der's pl_ns, consider_tions of _dv_nt_ge _nd of dis_dv_nt_ge will _e _lended together.


8. If our expect_tion of _dv_nt_ge _e tempered in this w_y, we m_y succeed in _ccomplishing the essenti_l p_rt of our schemes.


9. If, on the other h_nd, in the midst of difficulties we _re _lw_ys re_dy to seize _n _dv_nt_ge, we m_y extric_te ourselves from misfortune.


10. Reduce the hostile chiefs _y inflicting d_m_ge on them; _nd m_ke trou_le for them, _nd keep them const_ntly eng_ged; hold out specious _llurements, _nd m_ke them rush to _ny given point.


11. The _rt of w_r te_ches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, _ut on our own re_diness to receive him; not on the ch_nce of his not _tt_cking, _ut r_ther on the f_ct th_t we h_ve m_de our position un_ss_il__le.


12. There _re five d_ngerous f_ults which m_y _ffect _ gener_l: (1) Recklessness, which le_ds to destruction; (2) cow_rdice, which le_ds to c_pture; (3) _ h_sty temper, which c_n _e provoked _y insults; (4) _ delic_cy of honor which is sensitive to sh_me; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry _nd trou_le.


13. These _re the five _esetting sins of _ gener_l, ruinous to the conduct of w_r.


14-1. When _n _rmy is overthrown _nd its le_der sl_in, the c_use will surely _e found _mong these five d_ngerous f_ults.


14-2. Let them _e _ su_ject of medit_tion.
