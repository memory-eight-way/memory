III. ATTACK __ STRATAGEM


1-1. Sun Tzu said: __ the practical art __ war, the best thing __ all __ __ take the enemy's country whole and intact; __ shatter and destroy __ __ not __ good.


1-2. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture _ regiment, _ detachment or _ company entire than to destroy them.


2. Hence __ fight and conquer __ all your battles __ not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists __ breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.


3. Thus the highest form __ generalship __ __ balk the enemy's plans; the next best __ __ prevent the junction __ the enemy's forces; the next __ order __ __ attack the enemy's army __ the field; and the worst policy __ all __ __ besiege walled cities.


4-1. The rule is, not __ besiege walled cities __ __ can possibly __ avoided.


4-2. The preparation __ mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements __ war, will take __ three whole months; and the piling __ __ mounds over against the walls will take three months more.


5-1. The general, unable __ control his irritation, will launch his men __ the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third __ his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.


5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of _ siege.


6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; __ captures their cities without laying siege __ them; __ overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations __ the field.


7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing _ man, his triumph will be complete.


7-2. This __ the method __ attacking __ stratagem.


8. __ __ the rule __ war, __ our forces are ten __ the enemy's one, __ surround him; __ five __ one, __ attack him; __ twice __ numerous, __ divide our army into two.


9. __ equally matched, __ can offer battle; __ slightly inferior __ numbers, __ can avoid the enemy; __ quite unequal __ every way, __ can flee from him.


10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by _ small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.


11. Now the general __ the bulwark __ the State; __ the bulwark __ complete __ all points; the State will __ strong; __ the bulwark __ defective, the State will __ weak.


12. There are three ways in which _ ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--


13-1. (1) __ commanding the army __ advance __ __ retreat, being ignorant __ the fact that __ cannot obey.


13-2. This __ called hobbling the army.


14-1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers _ kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.


14-2. This causes restlessness __ the soldier's minds.


15-1. (3) __ employing the officers __ his army without discrimination, through ignorance __ the military principle __ adaptation __ circumstances.


15-2. This shakes the confidence __ the soldiers.


16-1. But when the army __ restless and distrustful, trouble __ sure __ come from the other feudal princes.


16-2. This __ simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.


17-1. Thus __ may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) __ will win who knows when __ fight and when not __ fight.


17-2. (2) __ will win who knows how __ handle both superior and inferior forces.


17-3. (3) __ will win whose army __ animated __ the same spirit throughout all its ranks.


17-4. (4) __ will win who, prepared himself, waits __ take the enemy unprepared.


17-5. (5) __ will win who has military capacity and __ not interfered with __ the sovereign.


18-1. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of _ hundred battles.


18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer _ defeat.


18-3. __ you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb __ every battle.
