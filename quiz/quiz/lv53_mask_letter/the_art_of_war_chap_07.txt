VII. M_NEUVERING


1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In w_r, the gener_l re_eives his _omm_n_s from the sovereign.


2. H_ving _olle_te_ _n _rmy _n_ _on_entr_te_ his for_es, he must _len_ _n_ h_rmonize the _ifferent elements thereof _efore pit_hing his __mp.


3-1. _fter th_t, _omes t__ti__l m_neuvering, th_n whi_h there is nothing more _iffi_ult.


3-2. The _iffi_ulty of t__ti__l m_neuvering _onsists in turning the _evious into the _ire_t, _n_ misfortune into g_in.


4. Thus, to t_ke _ long _n_ _ir_uitous route, _fter enti_ing the enemy out of the w_y, _n_ though st_rting _fter him, to _ontrive to re__h the go_l _efore him, shows knowle_ge of the _rtifi_e of _EVI_TION.


5. M_neuvering with _n _rmy is __v_nt_geous; with _n un_is_ipline_ multitu_e, most __ngerous.


6-1. If you set _ fully equippe_ _rmy in m_r_h in or_er to sn_t_h _n __v_nt_ge, the _h_n_es _re th_t you will _e too l_te.


6-2. On the other h_n_, to _et__h _ flying _olumn for the purpose involves the s__rifi_e of its __gg_ge _n_ stores.


7. Thus, if you or_er your men to roll up their _uff-_o_ts, _n_ m_ke for_e_ m_r_hes without h_lting __y or night, _overing _ou_le the usu_l _ist_n_e _t _ stret_h, _oing _ hun_re_ LI in or_er to wrest _n __v_nt_ge, the le__ers of _ll your three _ivisions will f_ll into the h_n_s of the enemy.


8. The stronger men will _e in front, the j__e_ ones will f_ll _ehin_, _n_ on this pl_n only one-tenth of your _rmy will re__h its _estin_tion.


9. If you m_r_h fifty LI in or_er to outm_neuver the enemy, you will lose the le__er of your first _ivision, _n_ only h_lf your for_e will re__h the go_l.


10. If you m_r_h thirty LI with the s_me o_je_t, two-thir_s of your _rmy will _rrive.


11. We m_y t_ke it then th_t _n _rmy without its __gg_ge-tr_in is lost; without provisions it is lost; without __ses of supply it is lost.


12. We __nnot enter into _lli_n_es until we _re __qu_inte_ with the _esigns of our neigh_ors.


13. We _re not fit to le__ _n _rmy on the m_r_h unless we _re f_mili_r with the f__e of the _ountry-- its mount_ins _n_ forests, its pitf_lls _n_ pre_ipi_es, its m_rshes _n_ sw_mps.


14. We sh_ll _e un__le to turn n_tur_l __v_nt_ge to ___ount unless we m_ke use of lo__l gui_es.


15. In w_r, pr__ti_e _issimul_tion, _n_ you will su__ee_.


16. Whether to _on_entr_te or to _ivi_e your troops, must _e _e_i_e_ _y _ir_umst_n_es.


17. Let your r_pi_ity _e th_t of the win_, your _omp__tness th_t of the forest.


18. In r_i_ing _n_ plun_ering _e like fire, in immov__ility like _ mount_in.


19. Let your pl_ns _e __rk _n_ impenetr__le _s night, _n_ when you move, f_ll like _ thun_er_olt.


20. When you plun_er _ _ountrysi_e, let the spoil _e _ivi_e_ _mongst your men; when you __pture new territory, _ut it up into _llotments for the _enefit of the sol_iery.


21. Pon_er _n_ _eli_er_te _efore you m_ke _ move.


22-1. He will _onquer who h_s le_rnt the _rtifi_e of _evi_tion.


22-2. Su_h is the _rt of m_neuvering.


23-1. The _ook of _rmy M_n_gement s_ys: On the fiel_ of __ttle, the spoken wor_ _oes not __rry f_r enough: hen_e the institution of gongs _n_ _rums.


23-2. Nor __n or_in_ry o_je_ts _e seen _le_rly enough: hen_e the institution of __nners _n_ fl_gs.


24. Gongs _n_ _rums, __nners _n_ fl_gs, _re me_ns where_y the e_rs _n_ eyes of the host m_y _e fo_use_ on one p_rti_ul_r point.


25-1. The host thus forming _ single unite_ _o_y, is it impossi_le either for the _r_ve to __v_n_e _lone, or for the _ow_r_ly to retre_t _lone.


25-2. This is the _rt of h_n_ling l_rge m_sses of men.


26. In night-fighting, then, m_ke mu_h use of sign_l-fires _n_ _rums, _n_ in fighting _y __y, of fl_gs _n_ __nners, _s _ me_ns of influen_ing the e_rs _n_ eyes of your _rmy.


27. _ whole _rmy m_y _e ro__e_ of its spirit; _ _omm_n_er-in-_hief m_y _e ro__e_ of his presen_e of min_.


28. Now _ sol_ier's spirit is keenest in the morning; _y noon__y it h_s _egun to fl_g; _n_ in the evening, his min_ is _ent only on returning to __mp.


29-1. _ _lever gener_l, therefore, _voi_s _n _rmy when its spirit is keen, _ut _tt__ks it when it is sluggish _n_ in_line_ to return.


29-2. This is the _rt of stu_ying moo_s.


30. _is_ipline_ _n_ __lm, to _w_it the _ppe_r_n_e of _isor_er _n_ hu__u_ _mongst the enemy:-- this is the _rt of ret_ining self-possession.


31. To _e ne_r the go_l while the enemy is still f_r from it, to w_it _t e_se while the enemy is toiling _n_ struggling, to _e well-fe_ while the enemy is f_mishe_:-- this is the _rt of hus__n_ing one's strength.


32. To refr_in from inter_epting _n enemy whose __nners _re in perfe_t or_er, to refr_in from _tt__king _n _rmy _r_wn up in __lm _n_ _onfi_ent _rr_y:-- this is the _rt of stu_ying _ir_umst_n_es.


33. It is _ milit_ry _xiom not to __v_n_e uphill _g_inst the enemy, nor to oppose him when he _omes _ownhill.


34. _o not pursue _n enemy who simul_tes flight; _o not _tt__k sol_iers whose temper is keen.


35-1. _o not sw_llow __it offere_ _y the enemy.


35-2. _o not interfere with _n _rmy th_t is returning home.


36-1. When you surroun_ _n _rmy, le_ve _n outlet free.


36-2. _o not press _ _esper_te foe too h_r_.


37. Su_h is the _rt of w_rf_re.
