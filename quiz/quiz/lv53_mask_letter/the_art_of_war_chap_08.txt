VIII. V_RI_TION IN T__TI_S

1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In w_r, the gener_l re_eives his _omm_n_s from the sovereign, _olle_ts his _rmy _n_ _on_entr_tes his for_es.

2-1. When in _iffi_ult _ountry, _o not en__mp.

2-2. In _ountry where high ro__s interse_t, join h_n_s with your _llies.

2-3. _o not linger in __ngerously isol_te_ positions.

2-4. In hemme_-in situ_tions, you must resort to str_t_gem.

2-5. In _esper_te position, you must fight.

3. There _re ro__s whi_h must not _e followe_, _rmies whi_h must _e not _tt__ke_, towns whi_h must not _e _esiege_, positions whi_h must not _e _onteste_, _omm_n_s of the sovereign whi_h must not _e o_eye_.

4. The gener_l who thoroughly un_erst_n_s the __v_nt_ges th_t ___omp_ny v_ri_tion of t__ti_s knows how to h_n_le his troops.

5. The gener_l who _oes not un_erst_n_ these, m_y _e well __qu_inte_ with the _onfigur_tion of the _ountry, yet he will not _e __le to turn his knowle_ge to pr__ti__l ___ount.

6. So, the stu_ent of w_r who is unverse_ in the _rt of w_r of v_rying his pl_ns, even though he _e __qu_inte_ with the Five __v_nt_ges, will f_il to m_ke the _est use of his men.

7. Hen_e in the wise le__er's pl_ns, _onsi_er_tions of __v_nt_ge _n_ of _is__v_nt_ge will _e _len_e_ together.

8. If our expe_t_tion of __v_nt_ge _e tempere_ in this w_y, we m_y su__ee_ in ___omplishing the essenti_l p_rt of our s_hemes.

9. If, on the other h_n_, in the mi_st of _iffi_ulties we _re _lw_ys re__y to seize _n __v_nt_ge, we m_y extri__te ourselves from misfortune.

10. Re_u_e the hostile _hiefs _y infli_ting __m_ge on them; _n_ m_ke trou_le for them, _n_ keep them _onst_ntly eng_ge_; hol_ out spe_ious _llurements, _n_ m_ke them rush to _ny given point.

11. The _rt of w_r te__hes us to rely not on the likelihoo_ of the enemy's not _oming, _ut on our own re__iness to re_eive him; not on the _h_n_e of his not _tt__king, _ut r_ther on the f__t th_t we h_ve m__e our position un_ss_il__le.

12. There _re five __ngerous f_ults whi_h m_y _ffe_t _ gener_l: (1) Re_klessness, whi_h le__s to _estru_tion; (2) _ow_r_i_e, whi_h le__s to __pture; (3) _ h_sty temper, whi_h __n _e provoke_ _y insults; (4) _ _eli___y of honor whi_h is sensitive to sh_me; (5) over-soli_itu_e for his men, whi_h exposes him to worry _n_ trou_le.

13. These _re the five _esetting sins of _ gener_l, ruinous to the _on_u_t of w_r.

14-1. When _n _rmy is overthrown _n_ its le__er sl_in, the __use will surely _e foun_ _mong these five __ngerous f_ults.

14-2. Let them _e _ su_je_t of me_it_tion.
