III. _TT__K _Y STR_T_GEM

1-1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In the pr__ti__l _rt of w_r, the _est thing of _ll is to t_ke the enemy's _ountry whole _n_ int__t; to sh_tter _n_ _estroy it is not so goo_.

1-2. So, too, it is _etter to re__pture _n _rmy entire th_n to _estroy it, to __pture _ regiment, _ _et__hment or _ _omp_ny entire th_n to _estroy them.

2. Hen_e to fight _n_ _onquer in _ll your __ttles is not supreme ex_ellen_e; supreme ex_ellen_e _onsists in _re_king the enemy's resist_n_e without fighting.

3. Thus the highest form of gener_lship is to __lk the enemy's pl_ns; the next _est is to prevent the jun_tion of the enemy's for_es; the next in or_er is to _tt__k the enemy's _rmy in the fiel_; _n_ the worst poli_y of _ll is to _esiege w_lle_ _ities.

4-1. The rule is, not to _esiege w_lle_ _ities if it __n possi_ly _e _voi_e_.

4-2. The prep_r_tion of m_ntlets, mov__le shelters, _n_ v_rious implements of w_r, will t_ke up three whole months; _n_ the piling up of moun_s over _g_inst the w_lls will t_ke three months more.

5-1. The gener_l, un__le to _ontrol his irrit_tion, will l_un_h his men to the _ss_ult like sw_rming _nts, with the result th_t one-thir_ of his men _re sl_in, while the town still rem_ins unt_ken.

5-2. Su_h _re the _is_strous effe_ts of _ siege.

6. Therefore the skillful le__er su__ues the enemy's troops without _ny fighting; he __ptures their _ities without l_ying siege to them; he overthrows their king_om without lengthy oper_tions in the fiel_.

7-1. With his for_es int__t he will _ispute the m_stery of the Empire, _n_ thus, without losing _ m_n, his triumph will _e _omplete.

7-2. This is the metho_ of _tt__king _y str_t_gem.

8. It is the rule in w_r, if our for_es _re ten to the enemy's one, to surroun_ him; if five to one, to _tt__k him; if twi_e _s numerous, to _ivi_e our _rmy into two.

9. If equ_lly m_t_he_, we __n offer __ttle; if slightly inferior in num_ers, we __n _voi_ the enemy; if quite unequ_l in every w_y, we __n flee from him.

10. Hen_e, though _n o_stin_te fight m_y _e m__e _y _ sm_ll for_e, in the en_ it must _e __pture_ _y the l_rger for_e.

11. Now the gener_l is the _ulw_rk of the St_te; if the _ulw_rk is _omplete _t _ll points; the St_te will _e strong; if the _ulw_rk is _efe_tive, the St_te will _e we_k.

12. There _re three w_ys in whi_h _ ruler __n _ring misfortune upon his _rmy:--

13-1. (1) _y _omm_n_ing the _rmy to __v_n_e or to retre_t, _eing ignor_nt of the f__t th_t it __nnot o_ey.

13-2. This is __lle_ ho__ling the _rmy.

14-1. (2) _y _ttempting to govern _n _rmy in the s_me w_y _s he __ministers _ king_om, _eing ignor_nt of the _on_itions whi_h o_t_in in _n _rmy.

14-2. This __uses restlessness in the sol_ier's min_s.

15-1. (3) _y employing the offi_ers of his _rmy without _is_rimin_tion, through ignor_n_e of the milit_ry prin_iple of ___pt_tion to _ir_umst_n_es.

15-2. This sh_kes the _onfi_en_e of the sol_iers.

16-1. _ut when the _rmy is restless _n_ _istrustful, trou_le is sure to _ome from the other feu__l prin_es.

16-2. This is simply _ringing _n_r_hy into the _rmy, _n_ flinging vi_tory _w_y.

17-1. Thus we m_y know th_t there _re five essenti_ls for vi_tory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight _n_ when not to fight.

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to h_n_le _oth superior _n_ inferior for_es.

17-3. (3) He will win whose _rmy is _nim_te_ _y the s_me spirit throughout _ll its r_nks.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prep_re_ himself, w_its to t_ke the enemy unprep_re_.

17-5. (5) He will win who h_s milit_ry __p__ity _n_ is not interfere_ with _y the sovereign.

18-1. Hen_e the s_ying: If you know the enemy _n_ know yourself, you nee_ not fe_r the result of _ hun_re_ __ttles.

18-2. If you know yourself _ut not the enemy, for every vi_tory g_ine_ you will _lso suffer _ _efe_t.

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will su__um_ in every __ttle.
