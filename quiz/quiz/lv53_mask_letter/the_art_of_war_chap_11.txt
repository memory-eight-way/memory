XI. THE NINE SITU_TIONS


1. Sun Tzu s_i_: The _rt of w_r re_ognizes nine v_rieties of groun_: (1) _ispersive groun_; (2) f__ile groun_; (3) _ontentious groun_; (4) open groun_; (5) groun_ of interse_ting highw_ys; (6) serious groun_; (7) _iffi_ult groun_; (8) hemme_-in groun_; (9) _esper_te groun_.


2. When _ _hieft_in is fighting in his own territory, it is _ispersive groun_.


3. When he h_s penetr_te_ into hostile territory, _ut to no gre_t _ist_n_e, it is f__ile groun_.


4. Groun_ the possession of whi_h imports gre_t __v_nt_ge to either si_e, is _ontentious groun_.


5. Groun_ on whi_h e__h si_e h_s li_erty of movement is open groun_.


6. Groun_ whi_h forms the key to three _ontiguous st_tes, so th_t he who o__upies it first h_s most of the Empire _t his _omm_n_, is _ groun_ of interse_ting highw_ys.


7. When _n _rmy h_s penetr_te_ into the he_rt of _ hostile _ountry, le_ving _ num_er of fortifie_ _ities in its re_r, it is serious groun_.


8. Mount_in forests, rugge_ steeps, m_rshes _n_ fens-- _ll _ountry th_t is h_r_ to tr_verse: this is _iffi_ult groun_.


9. Groun_ whi_h is re__he_ through n_rrow gorges, _n_ from whi_h we __n only retire _y tortuous p_ths, so th_t _ sm_ll num_er of the enemy woul_ suffi_e to _rush _ l_rge _o_y of our men: this is hemme_ in groun_.


10. Groun_ on whi_h we __n only _e s_ve_ from _estru_tion _y fighting without _el_y, is _esper_te groun_.


11-1. On _ispersive groun_, therefore, fight not.


11-2. On f__ile groun_, h_lt not.


11-3. On _ontentious groun_, _tt__k not.


12-1. On open groun_, _o not try to _lo_k the enemy's w_y.


12-2. On the groun_ of interse_ting highw_ys, join h_n_s with your _llies.


13-1. On serious groun_, g_ther in plun_er.


13-2. In _iffi_ult groun_, keep ste__ily on the m_r_h.


14-1. On hemme_-in groun_, resort to str_t_gem.


14-2. On _esper_te groun_, fight.


15. Those who were __lle_ skillful le__ers of ol_ knew how to _rive _ we_ge _etween the enemy's front _n_ re_r; to prevent _o-oper_tion _etween his l_rge _n_ sm_ll _ivisions; to hin_er the goo_ troops from res_uing the ___, the offi_ers from r_llying their men.


16. When the enemy's men were unite_, they m_n_ge_ to keep them in _isor_er.


17. When it w_s to their __v_nt_ge, they m__e _ forw_r_ move; when otherwise, they stoppe_ still.


18. If _ske_ how to _ope with _ gre_t host of the enemy in or_erly _rr_y _n_ on the point of m_r_hing to the _tt__k, I shoul_ s_y: "_egin _y seizing something whi_h your opponent hol_s _e_r; then he will _e _men__le to your will."


19. R_pi_ity is the essen_e of w_r: t_ke __v_nt_ge of the enemy's unre__iness, m_ke your w_y _y unexpe_te_ routes, _n_ _tt__k ungu_r_e_ spots.


20. The following _re the prin_iples to _e o_serve_ _y _n inv__ing for_e: The further you penetr_te into _ _ountry, the gre_ter will _e the soli__rity of your troops, _n_ thus the _efen_ers will not prev_il _g_inst you.


21. M_ke for_ys in fertile _ountry in or_er to supply your _rmy with foo_.


22-1. __refully stu_y the well-_eing of your men, _n_ _o not overt_x them.


22-2. _on_entr_te your energy _n_ ho_r_ your strength.


22-3. Keep your _rmy _ontinu_lly on the move, _n_ _evise unf_thom__le pl_ns.


23-1. Throw your sol_iers into positions when_e there is no es__pe, _n_ they will prefer _e_th to flight.


23-2. If they will f__e _e_th, there is nothing they m_y not __hieve.


23-3. Offi_ers _n_ men _like will put forth their uttermost strength.


24-1. Sol_iers when in _esper_te str_its lose the sense of fe_r.


24-2. If there is no pl__e of refuge, they will st_n_ firm.


24-3. If they _re in hostile _ountry, they will show _ stu__orn front.


24-4. If there is no help for it, they will fight h_r_.


25. Thus, without w_iting to _e m_rsh_le_, the sol_iers will _e _onst_ntly on the qui vive; without w_iting to _e _ske_, they will _o your will; without restri_tions, they will _e f_ithful; without giving or_ers, they __n _e truste_.


26-1. Prohi_it the t_king of omens, _n_ _o _w_y with superstitious _ou_ts.


26-2. Then, until _e_th itself _omes, no __l_mity nee_ _e fe_re_.


27. If our sol_iers _re not over_ur_ene_ with money, it is not _e__use they h_ve _ _ist_ste for ri_hes; if their lives _re not un_uly long, it is not _e__use they _re _isin_line_ to longevity.


28-1. On the __y they _re or_ere_ out to __ttle, your sol_iers m_y weep, those sitting up _e_ewing their g_rments, _n_ those lying _own letting the te_rs run _own their _heeks.


28-2. _ut let them on_e _e _rought to __y, _n_ they will _ispl_y the _our_ge of _ _hu or _ Kuei.


29-1. The skillful t__ti_i_n m_y _e likene_ to the shu_i-j_n.


29-2. Now the shu_i-j_n is _ sn_ke th_t is foun_ in the _hUng mount_ins.


29-3. Strike _t its he__, _n_ you will _e _tt__ke_ _y its t_il; strike _t its t_il, _n_ you will _e _tt__ke_ _y its he__; strike _t its mi__le, _n_ you will _e _tt__ke_ _y he__ _n_ t_il _oth.


30-1. _ske_ if _n _rmy __n _e m__e to imit_te the shu_i-j_n, I shoul_ _nswer, Yes.


30-2. For the men of Wu _n_ the men of Yueh _re enemies; yet if they _re _rossing _ river in the s_me _o_t _n_ _re __ught _y _ storm, they will _ome to e__h other's _ssist_n_e just _s the left h_n_ helps the right.


31. Hen_e it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, _n_ the _urying of _h_riot wheels in the groun_.


32. The prin_iple on whi_h to m_n_ge _n _rmy is to set up one st_n__r_ of _our_ge whi_h _ll must re__h.


33. How to m_ke the _est of _oth strong _n_ we_k-- th_t is _ question involving the proper use of groun_.


34. Thus the skillful gener_l _on_u_ts his _rmy just _s though he were le__ing _ single m_n, willy-nilly, _y the h_n_.


35. It is the _usiness of _ gener_l to _e quiet _n_ thus ensure se_re_y; upright _n_ just, _n_ thus m_int_in or_er.


36. He must _e __le to mystify his offi_ers _n_ men _y f_lse reports _n_ _ppe_r_n_es, _n_ thus keep them in tot_l ignor_n_e.


37-1. _y _ltering his _rr_ngements _n_ _h_nging his pl_ns, he keeps the enemy without _efinite knowle_ge.


37-2. _y shifting his __mp _n_ t_king _ir_uitous routes, he prevents the enemy from _nti_ip_ting his purpose.


38-1. _t the _riti__l moment, the le__er of _n _rmy __ts like one who h_s _lim_e_ up _ height _n_ then ki_ks _w_y the l___er _ehin_ him.


38-2. He __rries his men _eep into hostile territory _efore he shows his h_n_.


39. He _urns his _o_ts _n_ _re_ks his _ooking-pots; like _ shepher_ _riving _ flo_k of sheep, he _rives his men this w_y _n_ th_t, _n_ nothing knows whither he is going.


40. To muster his host _n_ _ring it into __nger:-- this m_y _e terme_ the _usiness of the gener_l.


41. The _ifferent me_sures suite_ to the nine v_rieties of groun_; the expe_ien_y of _ggressive or _efensive t__ti_s; _n_ the fun__ment_l l_ws of hum_n n_ture: these _re things th_t must most _ert_inly _e stu_ie_.


42. When inv__ing hostile territory, the gener_l prin_iple is, th_t penetr_ting _eeply _rings _ohesion; penetr_ting _ut _ short w_y me_ns _ispersion.


43-1. When you le_ve your own _ountry _ehin_, _n_ t_ke your _rmy __ross neigh_orhoo_ territory, you fin_ yourself on _riti__l groun_.


43-2. When there _re me_ns of _ommuni__tion on _ll four si_es, the groun_ is one of interse_ting highw_ys.


44-1. When you penetr_te _eeply into _ _ountry, it is serious groun_.


44-2. When you penetr_te _ut _ little w_y, it is f__ile groun_.


45-1. When you h_ve the enemy's stronghol_s on your re_r, _n_ n_rrow p_sses in front, it is hemme_-in groun_.


45-2. When there is no pl__e of refuge _t _ll, it is _esper_te groun_.


46-1. Therefore, on _ispersive groun_, I woul_ inspire my men with unity of purpose.


46-2. On f__ile groun_, I woul_ see th_t there is _lose _onne_tion _etween _ll p_rts of my _rmy.


47. On _ontentious groun_, I woul_ hurry up my re_r.


48-1. On open groun_, I woul_ keep _ vigil_nt eye on my _efenses.


48-2. On groun_ of interse_ting highw_ys, I woul_ _onsoli__te my _lli_n_es.


49-1. On serious groun_, I woul_ try to ensure _ _ontinuous stre_m of supplies.


49-2. On _iffi_ult groun_, I woul_ keep pushing on _long the ro__.


50-1. On hemme_-in groun_, I woul_ _lo_k _ny w_y of retre_t.


50-2. On _esper_te groun_, I woul_ pro_l_im to my sol_iers the hopelessness of s_ving their lives.


51. For it is the sol_ier's _isposition to offer _n o_stin_te resist_n_e when surroun_e_, to fight h_r_ when he __nnot help himself, _n_ to o_ey promptly when he h_s f_llen into __nger.


52-1. We __nnot enter into _lli_n_e with neigh_oring prin_es until we _re __qu_inte_ with their _esigns.


52-2. We _re not fit to le__ _n _rmy on the m_r_h unless we _re f_mili_r with the f__e of the _ountry-- its mount_ins _n_ forests, its pitf_lls _n_ pre_ipi_es, its m_rshes _n_ sw_mps.


52-3. We sh_ll _e un__le to turn n_tur_l __v_nt_ges to ___ount unless we m_ke use of lo__l gui_es.


53. To _e ignore_ of _ny one of the following four or five prin_iples _oes not _efit _ w_rlike prin_e.


54-1. When _ w_rlike prin_e _tt__ks _ powerful st_te, his gener_lship shows itself in preventing the _on_entr_tion of the enemy's for_es.


54-2. He over_wes his opponents, _n_ their _llies _re prevente_ from joining _g_inst him.


55-1. Hen_e he _oes not strive to _lly himself with _ll _n_ sun_ry, nor _oes he foster the power of other st_tes.


55-2. He __rries out his own se_ret _esigns, keeping his _nt_gonists in _we.


55-3. Thus he is __le to __pture their _ities _n_ overthrow their king_oms.


56. _estow rew_r_s without reg_r_ to rule, issue or_ers without reg_r_ to previous _rr_ngements; _n_ you will _e __le to h_n_le _ whole _rmy _s though you h__ to _o with _ut _ single m_n.


57-1. _onfront your sol_iers with the _ee_ itself; never let them know your _esign.


57-2. When the outlook is _right, _ring it _efore their eyes; _ut tell them nothing when the situ_tion is gloomy.


58. Pl__e your _rmy in _e__ly peril, _n_ it will survive; plunge it into _esper_te str_its, _n_ it will _ome off in s_fety.


59. For it is pre_isely when _ for_e h_s f_llen into h_rm's w_y th_t is __p__le of striking _ _low for vi_tory.


60. Su__ess in w_rf_re is g_ine_ _y __refully ___ommo__ting ourselves to the enemy's purpose.


61. _y persistently h_nging on the enemy's fl_nk, we sh_ll su__ee_ in the long run in killing the _omm_n_er-in-_hief.


62. This is __lle_ __ility to ___omplish _ thing _y sheer _unning.


63. On the __y th_t you t_ke up your _omm_n_, _lo_k the frontier p_sses, _estroy the offi_i_l t_llies, _n_ stop the p_ss_ge of _ll emiss_ries.


64. _e stern in the _oun_il-_h_m_er, so th_t you m_y _ontrol the situ_tion.


65. If the enemy le_ves _ _oor open, you must rush in.


66. Forest_ll your opponent _y seizing wh_t he hol_s _e_r, _n_ su_tly _ontrive to time his _rriv_l on the groun_.


67. W_lk in the p_th _efine_ _y rule, _n_ ___ommo__te yourself to the enemy until you __n fight _ _e_isive __ttle.


68. _t first, then, exhi_it the _oyness of _ m_i_en, until the enemy gives you _n opening; _fterw_r_s emul_te the r_pi_ity of _ running h_re, _n_ it will _e too l_te for the enemy to oppose you.
