IV. T__TI__L _ISPOSITIONS

1. Sun Tzu s_i_: The goo_ fighters of ol_ first put themselves _eyon_ the possi_ility of _efe_t, _n_ then w_ite_ for _n opportunity of _efe_ting the enemy.

2. To se_ure ourselves _g_inst _efe_t lies in our own h_n_s, _ut the opportunity of _efe_ting the enemy is provi_e_ _y the enemy himself.

3. Thus the goo_ fighter is __le to se_ure himself _g_inst _efe_t, _ut __nnot m_ke _ert_in of _efe_ting the enemy.

4. Hen_e the s_ying: One m_y know how to _onquer without _eing __le to _o it.

5. Se_urity _g_inst _efe_t implies _efensive t__ti_s; __ility to _efe_t the enemy me_ns t_king the offensive.

6. St_n_ing on the _efensive in_i__tes insuffi_ient strength; _tt__king, _ super__un__n_e of strength.

7-1. The gener_l who is skille_ in _efense hi_es in the most se_ret re_esses of the e_rth; he who is skille_ in _tt__k fl_shes forth from the topmost heights of he_ven.

7-2. Thus on the one h_n_ we h_ve __ility to prote_t ourselves; on the other, _ vi_tory th_t is _omplete.

8. To see vi_tory only when it is within the ken of the _ommon her_ is not the __me of ex_ellen_e.

9. Neither is it the __me of ex_ellen_e if you fight _n_ _onquer _n_ the whole Empire s_ys, "Well _one!"

10. To lift _n _utumn h_ir is no sign of gre_t strength; to see the sun _n_ moon is no sign of sh_rp sight; to he_r the noise of thun_er is no sign of _ qui_k e_r.

11. Wh_t the _n_ients __lle_ _ _lever fighter is one who not only wins, _ut ex_els in winning with e_se.

12. Hen_e his vi_tories _ring him neither reput_tion for wis_om nor _re_it for _our_ge.

13-1. He wins his __ttles _y m_king no mist_kes.

13-2. M_king no mist_kes is wh_t est__lishes the _ert_inty of vi_tory, for it me_ns _onquering _n enemy th_t is _lre__y _efe_te_.

14. Hen_e the skillful fighter puts himself into _ position whi_h m_kes _efe_t impossi_le, _n_ _oes not miss the moment for _efe_ting the enemy.

15. Thus it is th_t in w_r the vi_torious str_tegist only seeks __ttle _fter the vi_tory h_s _een won, where_s he who is _estine_ to _efe_t first fights _n_ _fterw_r_s looks for vi_tory.

16. The _onsumm_te le__er _ultiv_tes the mor_l l_w, _n_ stri_tly __heres to metho_ _n_ _is_ipline; thus it is in his power to _ontrol su__ess.

17. In respe_t of milit_ry metho_, we h_ve, firstly, Me_surement; se_on_ly, Estim_tion of qu_ntity; thir_ly, __l_ul_tion; fourthly, __l_n_ing of _h_n_es; fifthly, Vi_tory.

18. Me_surement owes its existen_e to E_rth; Estim_tion of qu_ntity to Me_surement; __l_ul_tion to Estim_tion of qu_ntity; __l_n_ing of _h_n_es to __l_ul_tion; _n_ Vi_tory to __l_n_ing of _h_n_es.

19. _ vi_torious _rmy oppose_ to _ route_ one, is _s _ poun_'s weight pl__e_ in the s__le _g_inst _ single gr_in.

20. The onrush of _ _onquering for_e is like the _ursting of pent-up w_ters into _ _h_sm _ thous_n_ f_thoms _eep.
