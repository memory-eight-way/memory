II. W_GING W_R


1-1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In the oper_tions of w_r, where there _re in the fiel_ _ thous_n_ swift _h_riots, _s m_ny he_vy _h_riots, _n_ _ hun_re_ thous_n_ m_il-_l__ sol_iers, with provisions enough to __rry them _ thous_n_ li, the expen_iture _t home _n_ _t the front, in_lu_ing entert_inment of guests, sm_ll items su_h _s glue _n_ p_int, _n_ sums spent on _h_riots _n_ _rmor, will re__h the tot_l of _ thous_n_ oun_es of silver per __y.


1-2. Su_h is the _ost of r_ising _n _rmy of 100,000 men.


2-1. When you eng_ge in __tu_l fighting, if vi_tory is long in _oming, then men's we_pons will grow _ull _n_ their _r_or will _e __mpe_.


2-2. If you l_y siege to _ town, you will exh_ust your strength.


3. _g_in, if the __mp_ign is protr__te_, the resour_es of the St_te will not _e equ_l to the str_in.


4-1. Now, when your we_pons _re _ulle_, your _r_or __mpe_, your strength exh_uste_ _n_ your tre_sure spent, other _hieft_ins will spring up to t_ke __v_nt_ge of your extremity.


4-2. Then no m_n, however wise, will _e __le to _vert the _onsequen_es th_t must ensue.


5. Thus, though we h_ve he_r_ of stupi_ h_ste in w_r, _leverness h_s never _een seen _sso_i_te_ with long _el_ys.


6. There is no inst_n_e of _ _ountry h_ving _enefite_ from prolonge_ w_rf_re.


7. It is only one who is thoroughly __qu_inte_ with the evils of w_r th_t __n thoroughly un_erst_n_ the profit__le w_y of __rrying it on.


8. The skillful sol_ier _oes not r_ise _ se_on_ levy, neither _re his supply-w_gons lo__e_ more th_n twi_e.


9-1. _ring w_r m_teri_l with you from home, _ut for_ge on the enemy.


9-2. Thus the _rmy will h_ve foo_ enough for its nee_s.


10-1. Poverty of the St_te ex_hequer __uses _n _rmy to _e m_int_ine_ _y _ontri_utions from _ _ist_n_e.


10-2. _ontri_uting to m_int_in _n _rmy _t _ _ist_n_e __uses the people to _e impoverishe_.


11. On the other h_n_, the proximity of _n _rmy __uses pri_es to go up; _n_ high pri_es __use the people's su_st_n_e to _e _r_ine_ _w_y.


12. When their su_st_n_e is _r_ine_ _w_y, the pe_s_ntry will _e _ffli_te_ _y he_vy ex__tions.


13,14. With this loss of su_st_n_e _n_ exh_ustion of strength, the homes of the people will _e strippe_ __re, _n_ three-tenths of their in_ome will _e _issip_te_; while government expenses for _roken _h_riots, worn-out horses, _re_st-pl_tes _n_ helmets, _ows _n_ _rrows, spe_rs _n_ shiel_s, prote_tive m_ntles, _r_ught-oxen _n_ he_vy w_gons, will _mount to four-tenths of its tot_l revenue.


15-1. Hen_e _ wise gener_l m_kes _ point of for_ging on the enemy.


15-2. One __rtlo__ of the enemy's provisions is equiv_lent to twenty of one's own, _n_ likewise _ single pi_ul of his proven_er is equiv_lent to twenty from one's own store.


16. Now in or_er to kill the enemy, our men must _e rouse_ to _nger; th_t there m_y _e __v_nt_ge from _efe_ting the enemy, they must h_ve their rew_r_s.


17-1. Therefore in _h_riot fighting, when ten or more _h_riots h_ve _een t_ken, those shoul_ _e rew_r_e_ who took the first.


17-2. Our own fl_gs shoul_ _e su_stitute_ for those of the enemy, _n_ the _h_riots mingle_ _n_ use_ in _onjun_tion with ours.


17-3. The __pture_ sol_iers shoul_ _e kin_ly tre_te_ _n_ kept.


18. This is __lle_, using the _onquere_ foe to _ugment one's own strength.


19. In w_r, then, let your gre_t o_je_t _e vi_tory, not lengthy __mp_igns.


20. Thus it m_y _e known th_t the le__er of _rmies is the _r_iter of the people's f_te, the m_n on whom it _epen_s whether the n_tion sh_ll _e in pe__e or in peril.
