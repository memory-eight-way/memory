VI. WE_K POINTS _N_ STRONG




1. Sun Tzu s_i_: Whoever is first in the fiel_ _n_ _w_its the _oming of the enemy, will _e fresh for the fight; whoever is se_on_ in the fiel_ _n_ h_s to h_sten to __ttle will _rrive exh_uste_.


2. Therefore the _lever _om__t_nt imposes his will on the enemy, _ut _oes not _llow the enemy's will to _e impose_ on him.


3. _y hol_ing out __v_nt_ges to him, he __n __use the enemy to _ppro__h of his own ___or_; or, _y infli_ting __m_ge, he __n m_ke it impossi_le for the enemy to _r_w ne_r.


4. If the enemy is t_king his e_se, he __n h_r_ss him; if well supplie_ with foo_, he __n st_rve him out; if quietly en__mpe_, he __n for_e him to move.


5. _ppe_r _t points whi_h the enemy must h_sten to _efen_; m_r_h swiftly to pl__es where you _re not expe_te_.


6. _n _rmy m_y m_r_h gre_t _ist_n_es without _istress, if it m_r_hes through _ountry where the enemy is not.

7-2. You __n ensure the s_fety of your _efense if you only hol_ positions th_t __nnot _e _tt__ke_.


8. Hen_e th_t gener_l is skillful in _tt__k whose opponent _oes not know wh_t to _efen_; _n_ he is skillful in _efense whose opponent _oes not know wh_t to _tt__k.


9-1. O _ivine _rt of su_tlety _n_ se_re_y!


9-2. Through you we le_rn to _e invisi_le, through you in_u_i_le; _n_ hen_e we __n hol_ the enemy's f_te in our h_n_s.


10. You m_y __v_n_e _n_ _e __solutely irresisti_le, if you m_ke for the enemy's we_k points; you m_y retire _n_ _e s_fe from pursuit if your movements _re more r_pi_ th_n those of the enemy.


11-1. If we wish to fight, the enemy __n _e for_e_ to _n eng_gement even though he _e sheltere_ _ehin_ _ high r_mp_rt _n_ _ _eep _it_h.


11-2. _ll we nee_ _o is _tt__k some other pl__e th_t he will _e o_lige_ to relieve.


12-1. If we _o not wish to fight, we __n prevent the enemy from eng_ging us even though the lines of our en__mpment _e merely tr__e_ out on the groun_.


12-2. _ll we nee_ _o is to throw something o__ _n_ un___ount__le in his w_y.


13. _y _is_overing the enemy's _ispositions _n_ rem_ining invisi_le ourselves, we __n keep our for_es _on_entr_te_, while the enemy's must _e _ivi_e_.


14-1. We __n form _ single unite_ _o_y, while the enemy must split up into fr__tions.


14-2. Hen_e there will _e _ whole pitte_ _g_inst sep_r_te p_rts of _ whole, whi_h me_ns th_t we sh_ll _e m_ny to the enemy's few.


15. _n_ if we _re __le thus to _tt__k _n inferior for_e with _ superior one, our opponents will _e in _ire str_its.


16. The spot where we inten_ to fight must not _e m__e known; for then the enemy will h_ve to prep_re _g_inst _ possi_le _tt__k _t sever_l _ifferent points; _n_ his for_es _eing thus _istri_ute_ in m_ny _ire_tions, the num_ers we sh_ll h_ve to f__e _t _ny given point will _e proportion_tely few.


17-1. For shoul_ the enemy strengthen his v_n, he will we_ken his re_r; shoul_ he strengthen his re_r, he will we_ken his v_n; shoul_ he strengthen his left, he will we_ken his right; shoul_ he strengthen his right, he will we_ken his left.


17-2. If he sen_s reinfor_ements everywhere, he will everywhere _e we_k.


18. Numeri__l we_kness _omes from h_ving to prep_re _g_inst possi_le _tt__ks; numeri__l strength, from _ompelling our __vers_ry to m_ke these prep_r_tions _g_inst us.


19. Knowing the pl__e _n_ the time of the _oming __ttle, we m_y _on_entr_te from the gre_test _ist_n_es in or_er to fight.


20-1. _ut if neither time nor pl__e _e known, then the left wing will _e impotent to su__or the right, the right equ_lly impotent to su__or the left, the v_n un__le to relieve the re_r, or the re_r to support the v_n.


20-2. How mu_h more so if the furthest portions of the _rmy _re _nything un_er _ hun_re_ LI _p_rt, _n_ even the ne_rest _re sep_r_te_ _y sever_l LI!


21-1. Though ___or_ing to my estim_te the sol_iers of Yueh ex_ee_ our own in num_er, th_t sh_ll __v_nt_ge them nothing in the m_tter of vi_tory.


21-2. I s_y then th_t vi_tory __n _e __hieve_.


22-1. Though the enemy _e stronger in num_ers, we m_y prevent him from fighting.


22-2. S_heme so _s to _is_over his pl_ns _n_ the likelihoo_ of their su__ess.


23-1. Rouse him, _n_ le_rn the prin_iple of his __tivity or in__tivity.


23-2. For_e him to reve_l himself, so _s to fin_ out his vulner__le spots.


24. __refully _omp_re the opposing _rmy with your own, so th_t you m_y know where strength is super__un__nt _n_ where it is _efi_ient.


25. In m_king t__ti__l _ispositions, the highest pit_h you __n _tt_in is to _on_e_l them; _on_e_l your _ispositions, _n_ you will _e s_fe from the prying of the su_tlest spies, from the m__hin_tions of the wisest _r_ins.


26. How vi_tory m_y _e pro_u_e_ for them out of the enemy's own t__ti_s-- th_t is wh_t the multitu_e __nnot _omprehen_.


27. _ll men __n see the t__ti_s where_y I _onquer, _ut wh_t none __n see is the str_tegy out of whi_h vi_tory is evolve_.

29. Milit_ry t__ti_s _re like unto w_ter; for w_ter in its n_tur_l _ourse runs _w_y from high pl__es _n_ h_stens _ownw_r_s.


30. So in w_r, the w_y is to _voi_ wh_t is strong _n_ to strike _t wh_t is we_k.
31. W_ter sh_pes its _ourse ___or_ing to the n_ture of the groun_ over whi_h it flows; the sol_ier works out his vi_tory in rel_tion to the foe whom he is f__ing.


32. Therefore, just _s w_ter ret_ins no _onst_nt sh_pe, so in w_rf_re there _re no _onst_nt _on_itions.


33. He who __n mo_ify his t__ti_s in rel_tion to his opponent _n_ there_y su__ee_ in winning, m_y _e __lle_ _ he_ven-_orn __pt_in.


34-1. The five elements (w_ter, fire, woo_, met_l, e_rth) _re not _lw_ys equ_lly pre_omin_nt; the four se_sons m_ke w_y for e__h other in turn.


34-2. There _re short __ys _n_ long; the moon h_s its perio_s of w_ning _n_ w_xing.
