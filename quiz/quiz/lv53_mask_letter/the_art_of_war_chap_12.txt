XII. THE _TT__K _Y FIRE


1-1. Sun Tzu s_i_: There _re five w_ys of _tt__king with fire.


1-2. The first is to _urn sol_iers in their __mp; the se_on_ is to _urn stores; the thir_ is to _urn __gg_ge tr_ins; the fourth is to _urn _rsen_ls _n_ m_g_zines; the fifth is to hurl _ropping fire _mongst the enemy.


2-1. In or_er to __rry out _n _tt__k, we must h_ve me_ns _v_il__le.


2-2. The m_teri_l for r_ising fire shoul_ _lw_ys _e kept in re__iness.


3. There is _ proper se_son for m_king _tt__ks with fire, _n_ spe_i_l __ys for st_rting _ _onfl_gr_tion.


4. The proper se_son is when the we_ther is very _ry; the spe_i_l __ys _re those when the moon is in the _onstell_tions of the Sieve, the W_ll, the Wing or the _ross-__r; for these four _re _ll __ys of rising win_.


5-1. In _tt__king with fire, one shoul_ _e prep_re_ to meet five possi_le _evelopments: 6.


5-2. (1) When fire _re_ks out insi_e to enemy's __mp, respon_ _t on_e with _n _tt__k from without.


7. (2) If there is _n out_re_k of fire, _ut the enemy's sol_iers rem_in quiet, _i_e your time _n_ _o not _tt__k.


8. (3) When the for_e of the fl_mes h_s re__he_ its height, follow it up with _n _tt__k, if th_t is pr__ti___le; if not, st_y where you _re.


9. (4) If it is possi_le to m_ke _n _ss_ult with fire from without, _o not w_it for it to _re_k out within, _ut _eliver your _tt__k _t _ f_vor__le moment.


10-1. (5) When you st_rt _ fire, _e to win_w_r_ of it.


10-2. _o not _tt__k from the leew_r_.


11. _ win_ th_t rises in the __ytime l_sts long, _ut _ night _reeze soon f_lls.


12. In every _rmy, the five _evelopments _onne_te_ with fire must _e known, the movements of the st_rs __l_ul_te_, _n_ _ w_t_h kept for the proper __ys.


13. Hen_e those who use fire _s _n _i_ to the _tt__k show intelligen_e; those who use w_ter _s _n _i_ to the _tt__k g_in _n ___ession of strength.


14. _y me_ns of w_ter, _n enemy m_y _e inter_epte_, _ut not ro__e_ of _ll his _elongings.


15. Unh_ppy is the f_te of one who tries to win his __ttles _n_ su__ee_ in his _tt__ks without _ultiv_ting the spirit of enterprise; for the result is w_ste of time _n_ gener_l st_gn_tion.


16. Hen_e the s_ying: The enlightene_ ruler l_ys his pl_ns well _he__; the goo_ gener_l _ultiv_tes his resour_es.


17. Move not unless you see _n __v_nt_ge; use not your troops unless there is something to _e g_ine_; fight not unless the position is _riti__l.


18. No ruler shoul_ put troops into the fiel_ merely to gr_tify his own spleen; no gener_l shoul_ fight _ __ttle simply out of pique.


19. If it is to your __v_nt_ge, m_ke _ forw_r_ move; if not, st_y where you _re.


20. _nger m_y in time _h_nge to gl__ness; vex_tion m_y _e su__ee_e_ _y _ontent.


21. _ut _ king_om th_t h_s on_e _een _estroye_ __n never _ome _g_in into _eing; nor __n the _e__ ever _e _rought ___k to life.


22-1. Hen_e the enlightene_ ruler is hee_ful, _n_ the goo_ gener_l full of __ution.


22-2. This is the w_y to keep _ _ountry _t pe__e _n_ _n _rmy int__t.
