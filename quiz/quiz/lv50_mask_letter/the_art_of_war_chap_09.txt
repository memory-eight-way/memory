24-1. Humble words _nd incre_sed prep_r_tions _re signs th_t the enemy is _bout to _dv_nce.

33-1. If there is disturb_nce in the c_mp, the gener_l's _uthority is we_k.


33-2. If the b_nners _nd fl_gs _re shifted _bout, sedition is _foot.


33-3. If the officers _re _ngry, it me_ns th_t the men _re we_ry.


34. When _n _rmy feeds its horses with gr_in _nd kills its c_ttle for food, _nd when the men do not h_ng their cooking-pots over the c_mp-fires, showing th_t they will not return to their tents, you m_y know th_t they _re determined to fight to the de_th.


35. The sight of men whispering together in sm_ll knots or spe_king in subdued tones points to dis_ffection _mongst the r_nk _nd file.


36. Too frequent rew_rds signify th_t the enemy is _t the end of his resources; too m_ny punishments betr_y _ condition of dire distress.

40-1. If our troops _re no more in number th_n the enemy, th_t is _mply sufficient; it only me_ns th_t no direct _tt_ck c_n be m_de.


40-2. Wh_t we c_n do is simply to concentr_te _ll our _v_il_ble strength, keep _ close w_tch on the enemy, _nd obt_in reinforcements.


41. He who exercises no forethought but m_kes light of his opponents is sure to be c_ptured by them.


42-1. If soldiers _re punished before they h_ve grown _tt_ched to you, they will not prove submissive; _nd, unless submissive, then will be pr_ctic_lly useless.


42-2. If, when the soldiers h_ve become _tt_ched to you, punishments _re not enforced, they will still be useless.


43-1. Therefore soldiers must be tre_ted in the first inst_nce with hum_nity, but kept under control by me_ns of iron discipline.


43-2. This is _ cert_in ro_d to victory.


44. If in tr_ining soldiers comm_nds _re h_bitu_lly enforced, the _rmy will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be b_d.
