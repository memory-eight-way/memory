XI. THE NINE SITU_TIONS

1. Sun Tzu s_id: The _rt of w_r recognizes nine v_rieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) f_cile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highw_ys; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desper_te ground.

2. When _ chieft_in is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.

3. When he h_s penetr_ted into hostile territory, but to no gre_t dist_nce, it is f_cile ground.

4. Ground the possession of which imports gre_t _dv_nt_ge to either side, is contentious ground.

5. Ground on which e_ch side h_s liberty of movement is open ground.

6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous st_tes, so th_t he who occupies it first h_s most of the Empire _t his comm_nd, is _ ground of intersecting highw_ys.

7. When _n _rmy h_s penetr_ted into the he_rt of _ hostile country, le_ving _ number of fortified cities in its re_r, it is serious ground.

8. Mount_in forests, rugged steeps, m_rshes _nd fens-- _ll country th_t is h_rd to tr_verse: this is difficult ground.

9. Ground which is re_ched through n_rrow gorges, _nd from which we c_n only retire by tortuous p_ths, so th_t _ sm_ll number of the enemy would suffice to crush _ l_rge body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.

10. Ground on which we c_n only be s_ved from destruction by fighting without del_y, is desper_te ground.

11-1. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not.

11-2. On f_cile ground, h_lt not.

11-3. On contentious ground, _tt_ck not.

12-1. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's w_y.

12-2. On the ground of intersecting highw_ys, join h_nds with your _llies.

13-1. On serious ground, g_ther in plunder.

13-2. In difficult ground, keep ste_dily on the m_rch.

14-1. On hemmed-in ground, resort to str_t_gem.

14-2. On desper_te ground, fight.

15. Those who were c_lled skillful le_ders of old knew how to drive _ wedge between the enemy's front _nd re_r; to prevent co-oper_tion between his l_rge _nd sm_ll divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the b_d, the officers from r_llying their men.

16. When the enemy's men were united, they m_n_ged to keep them in disorder.

17. When it w_s to their _dv_nt_ge, they m_de _ forw_rd move; when otherwise, they stopped still.

18. If _sked how to cope with _ gre_t host of the enemy in orderly _rr_y _nd on the point of m_rching to the _tt_ck, I should s_y: "Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds de_r; then he will be _men_ble to your will."

19. R_pidity is the essence of w_r: t_ke _dv_nt_ge of the enemy's unre_diness, m_ke your w_y by unexpected routes, _nd _tt_ck ungu_rded spots.

20. The following _re the principles to be observed by _n inv_ding force: The further you penetr_te into _ country, the gre_ter will be the solid_rity of your troops, _nd thus the defenders will not prev_il _g_inst you.

21. M_ke for_ys in fertile country in order to supply your _rmy with food.

22-1. C_refully study the well-being of your men, _nd do not overt_x them.

22-2. Concentr_te your energy _nd ho_rd your strength.

22-3. Keep your _rmy continu_lly on the move, _nd devise unf_thom_ble pl_ns.

23-1. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no esc_pe, _nd they will prefer de_th to flight.

23-2. If they will f_ce de_th, there is nothing they m_y not _chieve.

23-3. Officers _nd men _like will put forth their uttermost strength.

24-1. Soldiers when in desper_te str_its lose the sense of fe_r.

24-2. If there is no pl_ce of refuge, they will st_nd firm.

24-3. If they _re in hostile country, they will show _ stubborn front.

24-4. If there is no help for it, they will fight h_rd.

25. Thus, without w_iting to be m_rsh_led, the soldiers will be const_ntly on the qui vive; without w_iting to be _sked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be f_ithful; without giving orders, they c_n be trusted.

26-1. Prohibit the t_king of omens, _nd do _w_y with superstitious doubts.

26-2. Then, until de_th itself comes, no c_l_mity need be fe_red.

27. If our soldiers _re not overburdened with money, it is not bec_use they h_ve _ dist_ste for riches; if their lives _re not unduly long, it is not bec_use they _re disinclined to longevity.

28-1. On the d_y they _re ordered out to b_ttle, your soldiers m_y weep, those sitting up bedewing their g_rments, _nd those lying down letting the te_rs run down their cheeks.

28-2. But let them once be brought to b_y, _nd they will displ_y the cour_ge of _ Chu or _ Kuei.

29-1. The skillful t_ctici_n m_y be likened to the shu_i-j_n.

29-2. Now the shu_i-j_n is _ sn_ke th_t is found in the ChUng mount_ins.

29-3. Strike _t its he_d, _nd you will be _tt_cked by its t_il; strike _t its t_il, _nd you will be _tt_cked by its he_d; strike _t its middle, _nd you will be _tt_cked by he_d _nd t_il both.

30-1. _sked if _n _rmy c_n be m_de to imit_te the shu_i-j_n, I should _nswer, Yes.

30-2. For the men of Wu _nd the men of Yueh _re enemies; yet if they _re crossing _ river in the s_me bo_t _nd _re c_ught by _ storm, they will come to e_ch other's _ssist_nce just _s the left h_nd helps the right.

31. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, _nd the burying of ch_riot wheels in the ground.

32. The principle on which to m_n_ge _n _rmy is to set up one st_nd_rd of cour_ge which _ll must re_ch.

33. How to m_ke the best of both strong _nd we_k-- th_t is _ question involving the proper use of ground.

34. Thus the skillful gener_l conducts his _rmy just _s though he were le_ding _ single m_n, willy-nilly, by the h_nd.

35. It is the business of _ gener_l to be quiet _nd thus ensure secrecy; upright _nd just, _nd thus m_int_in order.

36. He must be _ble to mystify his officers _nd men by f_lse reports _nd _ppe_r_nces, _nd thus keep them in tot_l ignor_nce.

37-1. By _ltering his _rr_ngements _nd ch_nging his pl_ns, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.

37-2. By shifting his c_mp _nd t_king circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from _nticip_ting his purpose.

38-1. _t the critic_l moment, the le_der of _n _rmy _cts like one who h_s climbed up _ height _nd then kicks _w_y the l_dder behind him.

38-2. He c_rries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his h_nd.

39. He burns his bo_ts _nd bre_ks his cooking-pots; like _ shepherd driving _ flock of sheep, he drives his men this w_y _nd th_t, _nd nothing knows whither he is going.

40. To muster his host _nd bring it into d_nger:-- this m_y be termed the business of the gener_l.

41. The different me_sures suited to the nine v_rieties of ground; the expediency of _ggressive or defensive t_ctics; _nd the fund_ment_l l_ws of hum_n n_ture: these _re things th_t must most cert_inly be studied.

42. When inv_ding hostile territory, the gener_l principle is, th_t penetr_ting deeply brings cohesion; penetr_ting but _ short w_y me_ns dispersion.

43-1. When you le_ve your own country behind, _nd t_ke your _rmy _cross neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critic_l ground.

43-2. When there _re me_ns of communic_tion on _ll four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highw_ys.

44-1. When you penetr_te deeply into _ country, it is serious ground.

44-2. When you penetr_te but _ little w_y, it is f_cile ground.

45-1. When you h_ve the enemy's strongholds on your re_r, _nd n_rrow p_sses in front, it is hemmed-in ground.

45-2. When there is no pl_ce of refuge _t _ll, it is desper_te ground.

46-1. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose.

46-2. On f_cile ground, I would see th_t there is close connection between _ll p_rts of my _rmy.

47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my re_r.

48-1. On open ground, I would keep _ vigil_nt eye on my defenses.

48-2. On ground of intersecting highw_ys, I would consolid_te my _lli_nces.

49-1. On serious ground, I would try to ensure _ continuous stre_m of supplies.

49-2. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on _long the ro_d.

50-1. On hemmed-in ground, I would block _ny w_y of retre_t.

50-2. On desper_te ground, I would procl_im to my soldiers the hopelessness of s_ving their lives.

51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer _n obstin_te resist_nce when surrounded, to fight h_rd when he c_nnot help himself, _nd to obey promptly when he h_s f_llen into d_nger.

52-1. We c_nnot enter into _lli_nce with neighboring princes until we _re _cqu_inted with their designs.

52-2. We _re not fit to le_d _n _rmy on the m_rch unless we _re f_mili_r with the f_ce of the country-- its mount_ins _nd forests, its pitf_lls _nd precipices, its m_rshes _nd sw_mps.

52-3. We sh_ll be un_ble to turn n_tur_l _dv_nt_ges to _ccount unless we m_ke use of loc_l guides.

53. To be ignored of _ny one of the following four or five principles does not befit _ w_rlike prince.

54-1. When _ w_rlike prince _tt_cks _ powerful st_te, his gener_lship shows itself in preventing the concentr_tion of the enemy's forces.

54-2. He over_wes his opponents, _nd their _llies _re prevented from joining _g_inst him.

55-1. Hence he does not strive to _lly himself with _ll _nd sundry, nor does he foster the power of other st_tes.

55-2. He c_rries out his own secret designs, keeping his _nt_gonists in _we.

55-3. Thus he is _ble to c_pture their cities _nd overthrow their kingdoms.

56. Bestow rew_rds without reg_rd to rule, issue orders without reg_rd to previous _rr_ngements; _nd you will be _ble to h_ndle _ whole _rmy _s though you h_d to do with but _ single m_n.

57-1. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design.

57-2. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situ_tion is gloomy.

58. Pl_ce your _rmy in de_dly peril, _nd it will survive; plunge it into desper_te str_its, _nd it will come off in s_fety.

59. For it is precisely when _ force h_s f_llen into h_rm's w_y th_t is c_p_ble of striking _ blow for victory.

60. Success in w_rf_re is g_ined by c_refully _ccommod_ting ourselves to the enemy's purpose.

61. By persistently h_nging on the enemy's fl_nk, we sh_ll succeed in the long run in killing the comm_nder-in-chief.

62. This is c_lled _bility to _ccomplish _ thing by sheer cunning.

63. On the d_y th_t you t_ke up your comm_nd, block the frontier p_sses, destroy the offici_l t_llies, _nd stop the p_ss_ge of _ll emiss_ries.

64. Be stern in the council-ch_mber, so th_t you m_y control the situ_tion.

65. If the enemy le_ves _ door open, you must rush in.

66. Forest_ll your opponent by seizing wh_t he holds de_r, _nd subtly contrive to time his _rriv_l on the ground.

67. W_lk in the p_th defined by rule, _nd _ccommod_te yourself to the enemy until you c_n fight _ decisive b_ttle.

68. _t first, then, exhibit the coyness of _ m_iden, until the enemy gives you _n opening; _fterw_rds emul_te the r_pidity of _ running h_re, _nd it will be too l_te for the enemy to oppose you.
