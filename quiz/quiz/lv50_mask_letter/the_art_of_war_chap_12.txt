XII. THE _TT_CK BY FIRE


1-1. Sun Tzu s_id: There _re five w_ys of _tt_cking with fire.


1-2. The first is to burn soldiers in their c_mp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn b_gg_ge tr_ins; the fourth is to burn _rsen_ls _nd m_g_zines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire _mongst the enemy.


2-1. In order to c_rry out _n _tt_ck, we must h_ve me_ns _v_il_ble.


2-2. The m_teri_l for r_ising fire should _lw_ys be kept in re_diness.


3. There is _ proper se_son for m_king _tt_cks with fire, _nd speci_l d_ys for st_rting _ confl_gr_tion.


4. The proper se_son is when the we_ther is very dry; the speci_l d_ys _re those when the moon is in the constell_tions of the Sieve, the W_ll, the Wing or the Cross-b_r; for these four _re _ll d_ys of rising wind.


5-1. In _tt_cking with fire, one should be prep_red to meet five possible developments: 6.


5-2. (1) When fire bre_ks out inside to enemy's c_mp, respond _t once with _n _tt_ck from without.


7. (2) If there is _n outbre_k of fire, but the enemy's soldiers rem_in quiet, bide your time _nd do not _tt_ck.


8. (3) When the force of the fl_mes h_s re_ched its height, follow it up with _n _tt_ck, if th_t is pr_ctic_ble; if not, st_y where you _re.


9. (4) If it is possible to m_ke _n _ss_ult with fire from without, do not w_it for it to bre_k out within, but deliver your _tt_ck _t _ f_vor_ble moment.


10-1. (5) When you st_rt _ fire, be to windw_rd of it.


10-2. Do not _tt_ck from the leew_rd.


11. _ wind th_t rises in the d_ytime l_sts long, but _ night breeze soon f_lls.


12. In every _rmy, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the st_rs c_lcul_ted, _nd _ w_tch kept for the proper d_ys.


13. Hence those who use fire _s _n _id to the _tt_ck show intelligence; those who use w_ter _s _n _id to the _tt_ck g_in _n _ccession of strength.


14. By me_ns of w_ter, _n enemy m_y be intercepted, but not robbed of _ll his belongings.


15. Unh_ppy is the f_te of one who tries to win his b_ttles _nd succeed in his _tt_cks without cultiv_ting the spirit of enterprise; for the result is w_ste of time _nd gener_l st_gn_tion.


16. Hence the s_ying: The enlightened ruler l_ys his pl_ns well _he_d; the good gener_l cultiv_tes his resources.


17. Move not unless you see _n _dv_nt_ge; use not your troops unless there is something to be g_ined; fight not unless the position is critic_l.


18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gr_tify his own spleen; no gener_l should fight _ b_ttle simply out of pique.


19. If it is to your _dv_nt_ge, m_ke _ forw_rd move; if not, st_y where you _re.


20. _nger m_y in time ch_nge to gl_dness; vex_tion m_y be succeeded by content.


21. But _ kingdom th_t h_s once been destroyed c_n never come _g_in into being; nor c_n the de_d ever be brought b_ck to life.


22-1. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, _nd the good gener_l full of c_ution.


22-2. This is the w_y to keep _ country _t pe_ce _nd _n _rmy int_ct.
