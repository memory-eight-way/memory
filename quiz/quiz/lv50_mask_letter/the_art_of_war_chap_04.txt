IV. T_CTIC_L DISPOSITIONS


1. Sun Tzu s_id: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defe_t, _nd then w_ited for _n opportunity of defe_ting the enemy.


2. To secure ourselves _g_inst defe_t lies in our own h_nds, but the opportunity of defe_ting the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.


3. Thus the good fighter is _ble to secure himself _g_inst defe_t, but c_nnot m_ke cert_in of defe_ting the enemy.


4. Hence the s_ying: One m_y know how to conquer without being _ble to do it.


5. Security _g_inst defe_t implies defensive t_ctics; _bility to defe_t the enemy me_ns t_king the offensive.


6. St_nding on the defensive indic_tes insufficient strength; _tt_cking, _ super_bund_nce of strength.


7-1. The gener_l who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the e_rth; he who is skilled in _tt_ck fl_shes forth from the topmost heights of he_ven.


7-2. Thus on the one h_nd we h_ve _bility to protect ourselves; on the other, _ victory th_t is complete.


8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the _cme of excellence.


9. Neither is it the _cme of excellence if you fight _nd conquer _nd the whole Empire s_ys, "Well done!"


10. To lift _n _utumn h_ir is no sign of gre_t strength; to see the sun _nd moon is no sign of sh_rp sight; to he_r the noise of thunder is no sign of _ quick e_r.


11. Wh_t the _ncients c_lled _ clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with e_se.


12. Hence his victories bring him neither reput_tion for wisdom nor credit for cour_ge.


13-1. He wins his b_ttles by m_king no mist_kes.


13-2. M_king no mist_kes is wh_t est_blishes the cert_inty of victory, for it me_ns conquering _n enemy th_t is _lre_dy defe_ted.


14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into _ position which m_kes defe_t impossible, _nd does not miss the moment for defe_ting the enemy.


15. Thus it is th_t in w_r the victorious str_tegist only seeks b_ttle _fter the victory h_s been won, where_s he who is destined to defe_t first fights _nd _fterw_rds looks for victory.


16. The consumm_te le_der cultiv_tes the mor_l l_w, _nd strictly _dheres to method _nd discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.


17. In respect of milit_ry method, we h_ve, firstly, Me_surement; secondly, Estim_tion of qu_ntity; thirdly, C_lcul_tion; fourthly, B_l_ncing of ch_nces; fifthly, Victory.


18. Me_surement owes its existence to E_rth; Estim_tion of qu_ntity to Me_surement; C_lcul_tion to Estim_tion of qu_ntity; B_l_ncing of ch_nces to C_lcul_tion; _nd Victory to B_l_ncing of ch_nces.


19. _ victorious _rmy opposed to _ routed one, is _s _ pound's weight pl_ced in the sc_le _g_inst _ single gr_in.


20. The onrush of _ conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up w_ters into _ ch_sm _ thous_nd f_thoms deep.
