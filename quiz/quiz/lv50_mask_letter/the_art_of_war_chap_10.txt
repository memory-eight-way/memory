X. TERR_IN


1. Sun Tzu s_id: We m_y distinguish six kinds of terr_in, to wit: (1) _ccessible ground; (2) ent_ngling ground; (3) temporizing ground; (4) n_rrow p_sses; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions _t _ gre_t dist_nce from the enemy.


2. Ground which c_n be freely tr_versed by both sides is c_lled _ccessible.


3-1. With reg_rd to ground of this n_ture, be before the enemy in occupying the r_ised _nd sunny spots, _nd c_refully gu_rd your line of supplies.


3-2. Then you will be _ble to fight with _dv_nt_ge.


4. Ground which c_n be _b_ndoned but is h_rd to re-occupy is c_lled ent_ngling.


5-1. From _ position of this sort, if the enemy is unprep_red, you m_y s_lly forth _nd defe_t him.


5-2. But if the enemy is prep_red for your coming, _nd you f_il to defe_t him, then, return being impossible, dis_ster will ensue.


6. When the position is such th_t neither side will g_in by m_king the first move, it is c_lled temporizing ground.


7. In _ position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us _n _ttr_ctive b_it, it will be _dvis_ble not to stir forth, but r_ther to retre_t, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when p_rt of his _rmy h_s come out, we m_y deliver our _tt_ck with _dv_nt_ge.


8. With reg_rd to n_rrow p_sses, if you c_n occupy them first, let them be strongly g_rrisoned _nd _w_it the _dvent of the enemy.


9. Should the _rmy forest_ll you in occupying _ p_ss, do not go _fter him if the p_ss is fully g_rrisoned, but only if it is we_kly g_rrisoned.


10. With reg_rd to precipitous heights, if you _re beforeh_nd with your _dvers_ry, you should occupy the r_ised _nd sunny spots, _nd there w_it for him to come up.


11. If the enemy h_s occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retre_t _nd try to entice him _w_y.


12. If you _re situ_ted _t _ gre_t dist_nce from the enemy, _nd the strength of the two _rmies is equ_l, it is not e_sy to provoke _ b_ttle, _nd fighting will be to your dis_dv_nt_ge.


13-1. These six _re the principles connected with E_rth.


13-2. The gener_l who h_s _tt_ined _ responsible post must be c_reful to study them.


14-1. Now _n _rmy is exposed to six sever_l c_l_mities, not _rising from n_tur_l c_uses, but from f_ults for which the gener_l is responsible.


14-2. These _re: (1) Flight; (2) insubordin_tion; (3) coll_pse; (4) ruin; (5) disorg_niz_tion; (6) rout.


15. Other conditions being equ_l, if one force is hurled _g_inst _nother ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.


16-1. When the common soldiers _re too strong _nd their officers too we_k, the result is insubordin_tion.


16-2. When the officers _re too strong _nd the common soldiers too we_k, the result is coll_pse.


17. When the higher officers _re _ngry _nd insubordin_te, _nd on meeting the enemy give b_ttle on their own _ccount from _ feeling of resentment, before the comm_nder-in-chief c_n tell whether or not he is in _ position to fight, the result is ruin.


18. When the gener_l is we_k _nd without _uthority; when his orders _re not cle_r _nd distinct; when there _re no fixes duties _ssigned to officers _nd men, _nd the r_nks _re formed in _ slovenly h_ph_z_rd m_nner, the result is utter disorg_niz_tion.


19. When _ gener_l, un_ble to estim_te the enemy's strength, _llows _n inferior force to eng_ge _ l_rger one, or hurls _ we_k det_chment _g_inst _ powerful one, _nd neglects to pl_ce picked soldiers in the front r_nk, the result must be rout.


20. These _re six w_ys of courting defe_t, which must be c_refully noted by the gener_l who h_s _tt_ined _ responsible post.


21. The n_tur_l form_tion of the country is the soldier's best _lly; but _ power of estim_ting the _dvers_ry, of controlling the forces of victory, _nd of shrewdly c_lcul_ting difficulties, d_ngers _nd dist_nces, constitutes the test of _ gre_t gener_l.


22-1. He who knows these things, _nd in fighting puts his knowledge into pr_ctice, will win his b_ttles.


22-2. He who knows them not, nor pr_ctices them, will surely be defe_ted.


23. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even _t the ruler's bidding.


24. The gener_l who _dv_nces without coveting f_me _nd retre_ts without fe_ring disgr_ce, whose only thought is to protect his country _nd do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.


25. Reg_rd your soldiers _s your children, _nd they will follow you into the deepest v_lleys; look upon them _s your own beloved sons, _nd they will st_nd by you even unto de_th.


26. If, however, you _re indulgent, but un_ble to m_ke your _uthority felt; kind-he_rted, but un_ble to enforce your comm_nds; _nd inc_p_ble, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they _re useless for _ny pr_ctic_l purpose.


27. If we know th_t our own men _re in _ condition to _tt_ck, but _re un_w_re th_t the enemy is not open to _tt_ck, we h_ve gone only h_lfw_y tow_rds victory.


28. If we know th_t the enemy is open to _tt_ck, but _re un_w_re th_t our own men _re not in _ condition to _tt_ck, we h_ve gone only h_lfw_y tow_rds victory.


29. If we know th_t the enemy is open to _tt_ck, _nd _lso know th_t our men _re in _ condition to _tt_ck, but _re un_w_re th_t the n_ture of the ground m_kes fighting impr_ctic_ble, we h_ve still gone only h_lfw_y tow_rds victory.


30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he h_s broken c_mp, he is never _t _ loss.


31. Hence the s_ying: If you know the enemy _nd know yourself, your victory will not st_nd in doubt; if you know He_ven _nd know E_rth, you m_y m_ke your victory complete.
