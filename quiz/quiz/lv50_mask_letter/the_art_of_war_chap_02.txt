II. W_GING W_R

1-1. Sun Tzu s_id: In the oper_tions of w_r, where there _re in the field _ thous_nd swift ch_riots, _s m_ny he_vy ch_riots, _nd _ hundred thous_nd m_il-cl_d soldiers, with provisions enough to c_rry them _ thous_nd li, the expenditure _t home _nd _t the front, including entert_inment of guests, sm_ll items such _s glue _nd p_int, _nd sums spent on ch_riots _nd _rmor, will re_ch the tot_l of _ thous_nd ounces of silver per d_y.

1-2. Such is the cost of r_ising _n _rmy of 100,000 men.

2-1. When you eng_ge in _ctu_l fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's we_pons will grow dull _nd their _rdor will be d_mped.

2-2. If you l_y siege to _ town, you will exh_ust your strength.

3. _g_in, if the c_mp_ign is protr_cted, the resources of the St_te will not be equ_l to the str_in.

4-1. Now, when your we_pons _re dulled, your _rdor d_mped, your strength exh_usted _nd your tre_sure spent, other chieft_ins will spring up to t_ke _dv_nt_ge of your extremity.

4-2. Then no m_n, however wise, will be _ble to _vert the consequences th_t must ensue.

5. Thus, though we h_ve he_rd of stupid h_ste in w_r, cleverness h_s never been seen _ssoci_ted with long del_ys.

6. There is no inst_nce of _ country h_ving benefited from prolonged w_rf_re.

7. It is only one who is thoroughly _cqu_inted with the evils of w_r th_t c_n thoroughly underst_nd the profit_ble w_y of c_rrying it on.

8. The skillful soldier does not r_ise _ second levy, neither _re his supply-w_gons lo_ded more th_n twice.

9-1. Bring w_r m_teri_l with you from home, but for_ge on the enemy.

9-2. Thus the _rmy will h_ve food enough for its needs.

10-1. Poverty of the St_te exchequer c_uses _n _rmy to be m_int_ined by contributions from _ dist_nce.

10-2. Contributing to m_int_in _n _rmy _t _ dist_nce c_uses the people to be impoverished.

11. On the other h_nd, the proximity of _n _rmy c_uses prices to go up; _nd high prices c_use the people's subst_nce to be dr_ined _w_y.

12. When their subst_nce is dr_ined _w_y, the pe_s_ntry will be _fflicted by he_vy ex_ctions.

13,14. With this loss of subst_nce _nd exh_ustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped b_re, _nd three-tenths of their income will be dissip_ted; while government expenses for broken ch_riots, worn-out horses, bre_st-pl_tes _nd helmets, bows _nd _rrows, spe_rs _nd shields, protective m_ntles, dr_ught-oxen _nd he_vy w_gons, will _mount to four-tenths of its tot_l revenue.

15-1. Hence _ wise gener_l m_kes _ point of for_ging on the enemy.

15-2. One c_rtlo_d of the enemy's provisions is equiv_lent to twenty of one's own, _nd likewise _ single picul of his provender is equiv_lent to twenty from one's own store.

16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to _nger; th_t there m_y be _dv_nt_ge from defe_ting the enemy, they must h_ve their rew_rds.

17-1. Therefore in ch_riot fighting, when ten or more ch_riots h_ve been t_ken, those should be rew_rded who took the first.

17-2. Our own fl_gs should be substituted for those of the enemy, _nd the ch_riots mingled _nd used in conjunction with ours.

17-3. The c_ptured soldiers should be kindly tre_ted _nd kept.

18. This is c_lled, using the conquered foe to _ugment one's own strength.

19. In w_r, then, let your gre_t object be victory, not lengthy c_mp_igns.

20. Thus it m_y be known th_t the le_der of _rmies is the _rbiter of the people's f_te, the m_n on whom it depends whether the n_tion sh_ll be in pe_ce or in peril.
