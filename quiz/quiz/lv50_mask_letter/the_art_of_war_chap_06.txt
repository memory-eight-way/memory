VI. WE_K POINTS _ND STRONG




1. Sun Tzu s_id: Whoever is first in the field _nd _w_its the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field _nd h_s to h_sten to b_ttle will _rrive exh_usted.


2. Therefore the clever comb_t_nt imposes his will on the enemy, but does not _llow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.


3. By holding out _dv_nt_ges to him, he c_n c_use the enemy to _ppro_ch of his own _ccord; or, by inflicting d_m_ge, he c_n m_ke it impossible for the enemy to dr_w ne_r.


4. If the enemy is t_king his e_se, he c_n h_r_ss him; if well supplied with food, he c_n st_rve him out; if quietly enc_mped, he c_n force him to move.


5. _ppe_r _t points which the enemy must h_sten to defend; m_rch swiftly to pl_ces where you _re not expected.


6. _n _rmy m_y m_rch gre_t dist_nces without distress, if it m_rches through country where the enemy is not.


7-1. You c_n be sure of succeeding in your _tt_cks if you only _tt_ck pl_ces which _re undefended.


7-2. You c_n ensure the s_fety of your defense if you only hold positions th_t c_nnot be _tt_cked.


8. Hence th_t gener_l is skillful in _tt_ck whose opponent does not know wh_t to defend; _nd he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know wh_t to _tt_ck.


9-1. O divine _rt of subtlety _nd secrecy!


9-2. Through you we le_rn to be invisible, through you in_udible; _nd hence we c_n hold the enemy's f_te in our h_nds.


10. You m_y _dv_nce _nd be _bsolutely irresistible, if you m_ke for the enemy's we_k points; you m_y retire _nd be s_fe from pursuit if your movements _re more r_pid th_n those of the enemy.


11-1. If we wish to fight, the enemy c_n be forced to _n eng_gement even though he be sheltered behind _ high r_mp_rt _nd _ deep ditch.


11-2. _ll we need do is _tt_ck some other pl_ce th_t he will be obliged to relieve.


12-1. If we do not wish to fight, we c_n prevent the enemy from eng_ging us even though the lines of our enc_mpment be merely tr_ced out on the ground.


12-2. _ll we need do is to throw something odd _nd un_ccount_ble in his w_y.


13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions _nd rem_ining invisible ourselves, we c_n keep our forces concentr_ted, while the enemy's must be divided.


14-1. We c_n form _ single united body, while the enemy must split up into fr_ctions.


14-2. Hence there will be _ whole pitted _g_inst sep_r_te p_rts of _ whole, which me_ns th_t we sh_ll be m_ny to the enemy's few.


15. _nd if we _re _ble thus to _tt_ck _n inferior force with _ superior one, our opponents will be in dire str_its.


16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be m_de known; for then the enemy will h_ve to prep_re _g_inst _ possible _tt_ck _t sever_l different points; _nd his forces being thus distributed in m_ny directions, the numbers we sh_ll h_ve to f_ce _t _ny given point will be proportion_tely few.


17-1. For should the enemy strengthen his v_n, he will we_ken his re_r; should he strengthen his re_r, he will we_ken his v_n; should he strengthen his left, he will we_ken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will we_ken his left.


17-2. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be we_k.


18. Numeric_l we_kness comes from h_ving to prep_re _g_inst possible _tt_cks; numeric_l strength, from compelling our _dvers_ry to m_ke these prep_r_tions _g_inst us.


19. Knowing the pl_ce _nd the time of the coming b_ttle, we m_y concentr_te from the gre_test dist_nces in order to fight.


20-1. But if neither time nor pl_ce be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equ_lly impotent to succor the left, the v_n un_ble to relieve the re_r, or the re_r to support the v_n.


20-2. How much more so if the furthest portions of the _rmy _re _nything under _ hundred LI _p_rt, _nd even the ne_rest _re sep_r_ted by sever_l LI!


21-1. Though _ccording to my estim_te the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, th_t sh_ll _dv_nt_ge them nothing in the m_tter of victory.


21-2. I s_y then th_t victory c_n be _chieved.


22-1. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we m_y prevent him from fighting.


22-2. Scheme so _s to discover his pl_ns _nd the likelihood of their success.


23-1. Rouse him, _nd le_rn the principle of his _ctivity or in_ctivity.


23-2. Force him to reve_l himself, so _s to find out his vulner_ble spots.


24. C_refully comp_re the opposing _rmy with your own, so th_t you m_y know where strength is super_bund_nt _nd where it is deficient.


25. In m_king t_ctic_l dispositions, the highest pitch you c_n _tt_in is to conce_l them; conce_l your dispositions, _nd you will be s_fe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the m_chin_tions of the wisest br_ins.


26. How victory m_y be produced for them out of the enemy's own t_ctics-- th_t is wh_t the multitude c_nnot comprehend.


27. _ll men c_n see the t_ctics whereby I conquer, but wh_t none c_n see is the str_tegy out of which victory is evolved.
28. Do not repe_t the t_ctics which h_ve g_ined you one victory, but let your methods be regul_ted by the infinite v_riety of circumst_nces.


29. Milit_ry t_ctics _re like unto w_ter; for w_ter in its n_tur_l course runs _w_y from high pl_ces _nd h_stens downw_rds.


30. So in w_r, the w_y is to _void wh_t is strong _nd to strike _t wh_t is we_k.
31. W_ter sh_pes its course _ccording to the n_ture of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in rel_tion to the foe whom he is f_cing.


32. Therefore, just _s w_ter ret_ins no const_nt sh_pe, so in w_rf_re there _re no const_nt conditions.


33. He who c_n modify his t_ctics in rel_tion to his opponent _nd thereby succeed in winning, m_y be c_lled _ he_ven-born c_pt_in.


34-1. The five elements (w_ter, fire, wood, met_l, e_rth) _re not _lw_ys equ_lly predomin_nt; the four se_sons m_ke w_y for e_ch other in turn.


34-2. There _re short d_ys _nd long; the moon h_s its periods of w_ning _nd w_xing.
