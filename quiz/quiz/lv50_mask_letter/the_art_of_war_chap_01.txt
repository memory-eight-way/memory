I. L_YING PL_NS

1. Sun Tzu s_id: The _rt of w_r is of vit_l import_nce to the St_te.

2-1. It is _ m_tter of life _nd de_th, _ ro_d either to s_fety or to ruin.

2-2. Hence it is _ subject of inquiry which c_n on no _ccount be neglected.

3. The _rt of w_r, then, is governed by five const_nt f_ctors, to be t_ken into _ccount in one's deliber_tions, when seeking to determine the conditions obt_ining in the field.

4. These _re: (1) The Mor_l L_w; (2) He_ven; (3) E_rth; (4) The Comm_nder; (5) Method _nd discipline.

5,6. The Mor_l L_w c_uses the people to be in complete _ccord with their ruler, so th_t they will follow him reg_rdless of their lives, undism_yed by _ny d_nger.

7. He_ven signifies night _nd d_y, cold _nd he_t, times _nd se_sons.

8. E_rth comprises dist_nces, gre_t _nd sm_ll; d_nger _nd security; open ground _nd n_rrow p_sses; the ch_nces of life _nd de_th.

9. The Comm_nder st_nds for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, cour_ge _nd strictness.

10. By method _nd discipline _re to be understood the m_rsh_ling of the _rmy in its proper subdivisions, the gr_du_tions of r_nk _mong the officers, the m_inten_nce of ro_ds by which supplies m_y re_ch the _rmy, _nd the control of milit_ry expenditure.

11. These five he_ds should be f_mili_r to every gener_l: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will f_il.

12. Therefore, in your deliber_tions, when seeking to determine the milit_ry conditions, let them be m_de the b_sis of _ comp_rison, in this wise:--

13-1. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Mor_l l_w?

13-2. (2) Which of the two gener_ls h_s most _bility?

13-3. (3) With whom lie the _dv_nt_ges derived from He_ven _nd E_rth?

13-4. (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?

13-5. (5) Which _rmy is stronger?

13-6. (6) On which side _re officers _nd men more highly tr_ined?

13-7. (7) In which _rmy is there the gre_ter const_ncy both in rew_rd _nd punishment?

14. By me_ns of these seven consider_tions I c_n forec_st victory or defe_t.

15-1. The gener_l th_t he_rkens to my counsel _nd _cts upon it, will conquer: let such _ one be ret_ined in comm_nd!

15-2. The gener_l th_t he_rkens not to my counsel nor _cts upon it, will suffer defe_t:-- let such _ one be dismissed!

16. While he_ding the profit of my counsel, _v_il yourself _lso of _ny helpful circumst_nces over _nd beyond the ordin_ry rules.

17. _ccording _s circumst_nces _re f_vor_ble, one should modify one's pl_ns.

18. _ll w_rf_re is b_sed on deception.

19. Hence, when _ble to _tt_ck, we must seem un_ble; when using our forces, we must seem in_ctive; when we _re ne_r, we must m_ke the enemy believe we _re f_r _w_y; when f_r _w_y, we must m_ke him believe we _re ne_r.

20-1. Hold out b_its to entice the enemy.

20-2. Feign disorder, _nd crush him.

21-1. If he is secure _t _ll points, be prep_red for him.

21-2. If he is in superior strength, ev_de him.

22-1. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irrit_te him.

22-2. Pretend to be we_k, th_t he m_y grow _rrog_nt.

23-1. If he is t_king his e_se, give him no rest.

23-2. If his forces _re united, sep_r_te them.

24. _tt_ck him where he is unprep_red, _ppe_r where you _re not expected.

25. These milit_ry devices, le_ding to victory, must not be divulged beforeh_nd.

26-1. Now the gener_l who wins _ b_ttle m_kes m_ny c_lcul_tions in his temple ere the b_ttle is fought.

26-2. The gener_l who loses _ b_ttle m_kes but few c_lcul_tions beforeh_nd.

26-3. Thus do m_ny c_lcul_tions le_d to victory, _nd few c_lcul_tions to defe_t: how much more no c_lcul_tion _t _ll!

26-4. It is by _ttention to this point th_t I c_n foresee who is likely to win or lose.
