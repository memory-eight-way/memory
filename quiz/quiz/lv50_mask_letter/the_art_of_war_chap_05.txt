V. ENERGY


1. Sun Tzu s_id: The control of _ l_rge force is the s_me principle _s the control of _ few men: it is merely _ question of dividing up their numbers.


2. Fighting with _ l_rge _rmy under your comm_nd is nowise different from fighting with _ sm_ll one: it is merely _ question of instituting signs _nd sign_ls.


3. To ensure th_t your whole host m_y withst_nd the brunt of the enemy's _tt_ck _nd rem_in unsh_ken-- this is effected by m_neuvers direct _nd indirect.


4. Th_t the imp_ct of your _rmy m_y be like _ grindstone d_shed _g_inst _n egg-- this is effected by the science of we_k points _nd strong.


5. In _ll fighting, the direct method m_y be used for joining b_ttle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.


6. Indirect t_ctics, efficiently _pplied, _re inexh_ustible _s He_ven _nd E_rth, unending _s the flow of rivers _nd stre_ms; like the sun _nd moon, they end but to begin _new; like the four se_sons, they p_ss _w_y to return once more.


7. There _re not more th_n five music_l notes, yet the combin_tions of these five give rise to more melodies th_n c_n ever be he_rd.


8. There _re not more th_n five prim_ry colors (blue, yellow, red, white, _nd bl_ck), yet in combin_tion they produce more hues th_n c_n ever been seen.


9. There _re not more th_n five c_rdin_l t_stes (sour, _crid, s_lt, sweet, bitter), yet combin_tions of them yield more fl_vors th_n c_n ever be t_sted.


10. In b_ttle, there _re not more th_n two methods of _tt_ck-- the direct _nd the indirect; yet these two in combin_tion give rise to _n endless series of m_neuvers.


11-1. The direct _nd the indirect le_d on to e_ch other in turn.


11-2. It is like moving in _ circle-- you never come to _n end.


11-3. Who c_n exh_ust the possibilities of their combin_tion?


12. The onset of troops is like the rush of _ torrent which will even roll stones _long in its course.


13. The qu_lity of decision is like the well-timed swoop of _ f_lcon which en_bles it to strike _nd destroy its victim.


14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, _nd prompt in his decision.


15. Energy m_y be likened to the bending of _ crossbow; decision, to the rele_sing of _ trigger.


16. _mid the turmoil _nd tumult of b_ttle, there m_y be seeming disorder _nd yet no re_l disorder _t _ll; _mid confusion _nd ch_os, your _rr_y m_y be without he_d or t_il, yet it will be proof _g_inst defe_t.


17. Simul_ted disorder postul_tes perfect discipline, simul_ted fe_r postul_tes cour_ge; simul_ted we_kness postul_tes strength.


18. Hiding order bene_th the clo_k of disorder is simply _ question of subdivision; conce_ling cour_ge under _ show of timidity presupposes _ fund of l_tent energy; m_sking strength with we_kness is to be effected by t_ctic_l dispositions.


19-1. Thus one who is skillful _t keeping the enemy on the move m_int_ins deceitful _ppe_r_nces, _ccording to which the enemy will _ct.


19-2. He s_crifices something, th_t the enemy m_y sn_tch _t it.


20. By holding out b_its, he keeps him on the m_rch; then with _ body of picked men he lies in w_it for him.


21-1. The clever comb_t_nt looks to the effect of combined energy, _nd does not require too much from individu_ls.


21-2. Hence his _bility to pick out the right men _nd utilize combined energy.


22-1. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become _s it were like unto rolling logs or stones.


22-2. For it is the n_ture of _ log or stone to rem_in motionless on level ground, _nd to move when on _ slope; if four-cornered, to come to _ st_ndstill, but if round-sh_ped, to go rolling down.


23-1. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is _s the momentum of _ round stone rolled down _ mount_in thous_nds of feet in height.


23-2. So much on the subject of energy.
