III. _TT_CK BY STR_T_GEM

1-1. Sun Tzu s_id: In the pr_ctic_l _rt of w_r, the best thing of _ll is to t_ke the enemy's country whole _nd int_ct; to sh_tter _nd destroy it is not so good.

1-2. So, too, it is better to rec_pture _n _rmy entire th_n to destroy it, to c_pture _ regiment, _ det_chment or _ comp_ny entire th_n to destroy them.

2. Hence to fight _nd conquer in _ll your b_ttles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in bre_king the enemy's resist_nce without fighting.

3. Thus the highest form of gener_lship is to b_lk the enemy's pl_ns; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to _tt_ck the enemy's _rmy in the field; _nd the worst policy of _ll is to besiege w_lled cities.

4-1. The rule is, not to besiege w_lled cities if it c_n possibly be _voided.

4-2. The prep_r_tion of m_ntlets, mov_ble shelters, _nd v_rious implements of w_r, will t_ke up three whole months; _nd the piling up of mounds over _g_inst the w_lls will t_ke three months more.

5-1. The gener_l, un_ble to control his irrit_tion, will l_unch his men to the _ss_ult like sw_rming _nts, with the result th_t one-third of his men _re sl_in, while the town still rem_ins unt_ken.

5-2. Such _re the dis_strous effects of _ siege.

6. Therefore the skillful le_der subdues the enemy's troops without _ny fighting; he c_ptures their cities without l_ying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy oper_tions in the field.

7-1. With his forces int_ct he will dispute the m_stery of the Empire, _nd thus, without losing _ m_n, his triumph will be complete.

7-2. This is the method of _tt_cking by str_t_gem.

8. It is the rule in w_r, if our forces _re ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to _tt_ck him; if twice _s numerous, to divide our _rmy into two.

9. If equ_lly m_tched, we c_n offer b_ttle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we c_n _void the enemy; if quite unequ_l in every w_y, we c_n flee from him.

10. Hence, though _n obstin_te fight m_y be m_de by _ sm_ll force, in the end it must be c_ptured by the l_rger force.

11. Now the gener_l is the bulw_rk of the St_te; if the bulw_rk is complete _t _ll points; the St_te will be strong; if the bulw_rk is defective, the St_te will be we_k.

12. There _re three w_ys in which _ ruler c_n bring misfortune upon his _rmy:--

13-1. (1) By comm_nding the _rmy to _dv_nce or to retre_t, being ignor_nt of the f_ct th_t it c_nnot obey.

13-2. This is c_lled hobbling the _rmy.

14-1. (2) By _ttempting to govern _n _rmy in the s_me w_y _s he _dministers _ kingdom, being ignor_nt of the conditions which obt_in in _n _rmy.

14-2. This c_uses restlessness in the soldier's minds.

15-1. (3) By employing the officers of his _rmy without discrimin_tion, through ignor_nce of the milit_ry principle of _d_pt_tion to circumst_nces.

15-2. This sh_kes the confidence of the soldiers.

16-1. But when the _rmy is restless _nd distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feud_l princes.

16-2. This is simply bringing _n_rchy into the _rmy, _nd flinging victory _w_y.

17-1. Thus we m_y know th_t there _re five essenti_ls for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight _nd when not to fight.

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to h_ndle both superior _nd inferior forces.

17-3. (3) He will win whose _rmy is _nim_ted by the s_me spirit throughout _ll its r_nks.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prep_red himself, w_its to t_ke the enemy unprep_red.

17-5. (5) He will win who h_s milit_ry c_p_city _nd is not interfered with by the sovereign.

18-1. Hence the s_ying: If you know the enemy _nd know yourself, you need not fe_r the result of _ hundred b_ttles.

18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory g_ined you will _lso suffer _ defe_t.

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every b_ttle.
