VII. M_NEUVERING


1. Sun Tzu s_id: In w_r, the gener_l receives his comm_nds from the sovereign.


2. H_ving collected _n _rmy _nd concentr_ted his forces, he must blend _nd h_rmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his c_mp.


3-1. _fter th_t, comes t_ctic_l m_neuvering, th_n which there is nothing more difficult.


3-2. The difficulty of t_ctic_l m_neuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, _nd misfortune into g_in.


4. Thus, to t_ke _ long _nd circuitous route, _fter enticing the enemy out of the w_y, _nd though st_rting _fter him, to contrive to re_ch the go_l before him, shows knowledge of the _rtifice of DEVI_TION.


5. M_neuvering with _n _rmy is _dv_nt_geous; with _n undisciplined multitude, most d_ngerous.


6-1. If you set _ fully equipped _rmy in m_rch in order to sn_tch _n _dv_nt_ge, the ch_nces _re th_t you will be too l_te.


6-2. On the other h_nd, to det_ch _ flying column for the purpose involves the s_crifice of its b_gg_ge _nd stores.


7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-co_ts, _nd m_ke forced m_rches without h_lting d_y or night, covering double the usu_l dist_nce _t _ stretch, doing _ hundred LI in order to wrest _n _dv_nt_ge, the le_ders of _ll your three divisions will f_ll into the h_nds of the enemy.


8. The stronger men will be in front, the j_ded ones will f_ll behind, _nd on this pl_n only one-tenth of your _rmy will re_ch its destin_tion.


9. If you m_rch fifty LI in order to outm_neuver the enemy, you will lose the le_der of your first division, _nd only h_lf your force will re_ch the go_l.


10. If you m_rch thirty LI with the s_me object, two-thirds of your _rmy will _rrive.


11. We m_y t_ke it then th_t _n _rmy without its b_gg_ge-tr_in is lost; without provisions it is lost; without b_ses of supply it is lost.


12. We c_nnot enter into _lli_nces until we _re _cqu_inted with the designs of our neighbors.


13. We _re not fit to le_d _n _rmy on the m_rch unless we _re f_mili_r with the f_ce of the country-- its mount_ins _nd forests, its pitf_lls _nd precipices, its m_rshes _nd sw_mps.


14. We sh_ll be un_ble to turn n_tur_l _dv_nt_ge to _ccount unless we m_ke use of loc_l guides.


15. In w_r, pr_ctice dissimul_tion, _nd you will succeed.


16. Whether to concentr_te or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumst_nces.


17. Let your r_pidity be th_t of the wind, your comp_ctness th_t of the forest.


18. In r_iding _nd plundering be like fire, in immov_bility like _ mount_in.


19. Let your pl_ns be d_rk _nd impenetr_ble _s night, _nd when you move, f_ll like _ thunderbolt.


20. When you plunder _ countryside, let the spoil be divided _mongst your men; when you c_pture new territory, cut it up into _llotments for the benefit of the soldiery.


21. Ponder _nd deliber_te before you m_ke _ move.


22-1. He will conquer who h_s le_rnt the _rtifice of devi_tion.


22-2. Such is the _rt of m_neuvering.


23-1. The Book of _rmy M_n_gement s_ys: On the field of b_ttle, the spoken word does not c_rry f_r enough: hence the institution of gongs _nd drums.


23-2. Nor c_n ordin_ry objects be seen cle_rly enough: hence the institution of b_nners _nd fl_gs.


24. Gongs _nd drums, b_nners _nd fl_gs, _re me_ns whereby the e_rs _nd eyes of the host m_y be focused on one p_rticul_r point.


25-1. The host thus forming _ single united body, is it impossible either for the br_ve to _dv_nce _lone, or for the cow_rdly to retre_t _lone.


25-2. This is the _rt of h_ndling l_rge m_sses of men.


26. In night-fighting, then, m_ke much use of sign_l-fires _nd drums, _nd in fighting by d_y, of fl_gs _nd b_nners, _s _ me_ns of influencing the e_rs _nd eyes of your _rmy.


27. _ whole _rmy m_y be robbed of its spirit; _ comm_nder-in-chief m_y be robbed of his presence of mind.


28. Now _ soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noond_y it h_s begun to fl_g; _nd in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to c_mp.


29-1. _ clever gener_l, therefore, _voids _n _rmy when its spirit is keen, but _tt_cks it when it is sluggish _nd inclined to return.


29-2. This is the _rt of studying moods.


30. Disciplined _nd c_lm, to _w_it the _ppe_r_nce of disorder _nd hubbub _mongst the enemy:-- this is the _rt of ret_ining self-possession.


31. To be ne_r the go_l while the enemy is still f_r from it, to w_it _t e_se while the enemy is toiling _nd struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is f_mished:-- this is the _rt of husb_nding one's strength.


32. To refr_in from intercepting _n enemy whose b_nners _re in perfect order, to refr_in from _tt_cking _n _rmy dr_wn up in c_lm _nd confident _rr_y:-- this is the _rt of studying circumst_nces.


33. It is _ milit_ry _xiom not to _dv_nce uphill _g_inst the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.


34. Do not pursue _n enemy who simul_tes flight; do not _tt_ck soldiers whose temper is keen.


35-1. Do not sw_llow b_it offered by the enemy.


35-2. Do not interfere with _n _rmy th_t is returning home.


36-1. When you surround _n _rmy, le_ve _n outlet free.


36-2. Do not press _ desper_te foe too h_rd.


37. Such is the _rt of w_rf_re.
