IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS
IV. TACTIC__ DISPOSITIO__

1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
1. S__ T__ sai__ T__ go__ fighte__ __ o__ fir__ p__ themselv__ beyo__ t__ possibili__ __ defea__ a__ th__ wait__ f__ __ opportuni__ __ defeati__ t__ enem__

2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
2. __ secu__ ourselv__ again__ defe__ li__ __ o__ o__ hand__ b__ t__ opportuni__ __ defeati__ t__ ene__ __ provid__ __ t__ ene__ himsel__

3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
3. Th__ t__ go__ fight__ __ ab__ __ secu__ himse__ again__ defea__ b__ cann__ ma__ certa__ __ defeati__ t__ enem__

4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
4. Hen__ t__ sayin__ O__ m__ kn__ h__ __ conqu__ witho__ bei__ ab__ __ __ i__

5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
5. Securi__ again__ defe__ impli__ defensi__ tactic__ abili__ __ defe__ t__ ene__ mea__ taki__ t__ offensiv__

6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.
6. Standi__ __ t__ defensi__ indicat__ insufficie__ strengt__ attackin__ _ superabundan__ __ strengt__

7-1. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.
7-1. T__ gener__ w__ __ skill__ __ defen__ hid__ __ t__ mo__ secr__ recess__ __ t__ eart__ __ w__ __ skill__ __ atta__ flash__ for__ fr__ t__ topmo__ heigh__ __ heave__

7-2. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.
7-2. Th__ __ t__ o__ ha__ __ ha__ abili__ __ prote__ ourselve__ __ t__ othe__ _ victo__ th__ __ complet__

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
8. __ s__ victo__ on__ wh__ __ __ with__ t__ k__ __ t__ comm__ he__ __ n__ t__ ac__ __ excellenc__

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
9. Neith__ __ __ t__ ac__ __ excellen__ __ y__ fig__ a__ conqu__ a__ t__ who__ Empi__ say__ "We__ done__

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
10. __ li__ __ autu__ ha__ __ __ si__ __ gre__ strengt__ __ s__ t__ s__ a__ mo__ __ __ si__ __ sha__ sigh__ __ he__ t__ noi__ __ thund__ __ __ si__ __ _ qui__ ea__

11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
11. Wh__ t__ ancien__ call__ _ clev__ fight__ __ o__ w__ n__ on__ win__ b__ exce__ __ winni__ wi__ eas__

12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.
12. Hen__ h__ victori__ bri__ h__ neith__ reputati__ f__ wisd__ n__ cred__ f__ courag__

13-1. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
13-1. __ wi__ h__ battl__ __ maki__ __ mistake__

13-2. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
13-2. Maki__ __ mistak__ __ wh__ establish__ t__ certain__ __ victor__ f__ __ mea__ conqueri__ __ ene__ th__ __ alrea__ defeate__

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
14. Hen__ t__ skillf__ fight__ pu__ himse__ in__ _ positi__ whi__ mak__ defe__ impossibl__ a__ do__ n__ mi__ t__ mome__ f__ defeati__ t__ enem__

15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
15. Th__ __ __ th__ __ w__ t__ victorio__ strategi__ on__ see__ batt__ aft__ t__ victo__ h__ be__ wo__ where__ __ w__ __ destin__ __ defe__ fir__ figh__ a__ afterwar__ loo__ f__ victor__

16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.
16. T__ consumma__ lead__ cultivat__ t__ mor__ la__ a__ strict__ adher__ __ meth__ a__ disciplin__ th__ __ __ __ h__ pow__ __ contr__ succes__

17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.
17. __ respe__ __ milita__ metho__ __ hav__ firstl__ Measuremen__ secondl__ Estimati__ __ quantit__ thirdl__ Calculatio__ fourthl__ Balanci__ __ chance__ fifthl__ Victor__

18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
18. Measureme__ ow__ i__ existen__ __ Eart__ Estimati__ __ quanti__ __ Measuremen__ Calculati__ __ Estimati__ __ quantit__ Balanci__ __ chanc__ __ Calculatio__ a__ Victo__ __ Balanci__ __ chance__

19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.
19. _ victorio__ ar__ oppos__ __ _ rout__ on__ __ __ _ pound__ weig__ plac__ __ t__ sca__ again__ _ sing__ grai__

20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
20. T__ onru__ __ _ conqueri__ for__ __ li__ t__ bursti__ __ pent-__ wate__ in__ _ cha__ _ thousa__ fatho__ dee__
