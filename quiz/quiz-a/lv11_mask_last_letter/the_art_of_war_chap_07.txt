4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.

6-2. __ t__ oth__ han__ __ deta__ _ flyi__ colu__ f__ t__ purpo__ involv__ t__ sacrifi__ __ i__ bagga__ a__ store__

7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.
7. Thu__ __ y__ ord__ yo__ m__ __ ro__ __ the__ buff-coat__ a__ ma__ forc__ march__ witho__ halti__ d__ __ nigh__ coveri__ doub__ t__ usu__ distan__ __ _ stretc__ doi__ _ hundr__ __ __ ord__ __ wre__ __ advantag__ t__ leade__ __ a__ yo__ thr__ divisio__ wi__ fa__ in__ t__ han__ __ t__ enem__

10. __ y__ mar__ thir__ __ wi__ t__ sa__ objec__ two-thir__ __ yo__ ar__ wi__ arriv__

12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.
12. __ cann__ ent__ in__ allianc__ unt__ __ a__ acquaint__ wi__ t__ desig__ __ o__ neighbor__

13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country-- its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.

19. L__ yo__ pla__ __ da__ a__ impenetrab__ __ nigh__ a__ wh__ y__ mov__ fa__ li__ _ thunderbol__

20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.
