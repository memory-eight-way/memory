6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.
6. S__ t__ stude__ __ w__ w__ __ unvers__ __ t__ a__ __ w__ __ varyi__ h__ plan__ ev__ thou__ __ __ acquaint__ wi__ t__ Fi__ Advantage__ wi__ fa__ __ ma__ t__ be__ u__ __ h__ me__

8. __ o__ expectati__ __ advanta__ __ temper__ __ th__ wa__ __ m__ succe__ __ accomplishi__ t__ essenti__ pa__ __ o__ scheme__

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.
9. I__ __ t__ oth__ han__ __ t__ mid__ __ difficulti__ __ a__ alwa__ rea__ __ sei__ __ advantag__ __ m__ extrica__ ourselv__ fr__ misfortun__

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
