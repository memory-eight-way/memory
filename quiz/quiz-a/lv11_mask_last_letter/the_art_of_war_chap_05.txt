15. Ener__ m__ __ liken__ __ t__ bendi__ __ _ crossbo__ decisio__ __ t__ releasi__ __ _ trigge__

16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.
