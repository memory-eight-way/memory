III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM
III. _TT__K _Y STR_T_G_M

1-1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
1-1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In th_ pr__ti__l _rt of w_r, th_ __st thing of _ll is to t_k_ th_ _n_my's _ountry whol_ _n_ int__t; to sh_tt_r _n_ __stroy it is not so goo_.

1-2. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
1-2. So, too, it is __tt_r to r___ptur_ _n _rmy _ntir_ th_n to __stroy it, to __ptur_ _ r_gim_nt, _ __t__hm_nt or _ _omp_ny _ntir_ th_n to __stroy th_m.

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
2. H_n__ to fight _n_ _onqu_r in _ll your __ttl_s is not supr_m_ _x__ll_n__; supr_m_ _x__ll_n__ _onsists in _r__king th_ _n_my's r_sist_n__ without fighting.

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
3. Thus th_ high_st form of g_n_r_lship is to __lk th_ _n_my's pl_ns; th_ n_xt __st is to pr_v_nt th_ jun_tion of th_ _n_my's for__s; th_ n_xt in or__r is to _tt__k th_ _n_my's _rmy in th_ fi_l_; _n_ th_ worst poli_y of _ll is to __si_g_ w_ll__ _iti_s.

4-1. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.
4-1. Th_ rul_ is, not to __si_g_ w_ll__ _iti_s if it __n possi_ly __ _voi___.

4-2. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.
4-2. Th_ pr_p_r_tion of m_ntl_ts, mov__l_ sh_lt_rs, _n_ v_rious impl_m_nts of w_r, will t_k_ up thr__ whol_ months; _n_ th_ piling up of moun_s ov_r _g_inst th_ w_lls will t_k_ thr__ months mor_.

5-1. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.
5-1. Th_ g_n_r_l, un__l_ to _ontrol his irrit_tion, will l_un_h his m_n to th_ _ss_ult lik_ sw_rming _nts, with th_ r_sult th_t on_-thir_ of his m_n _r_ sl_in, whil_ th_ town still r_m_ins unt_k_n.

5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
5-2. Su_h _r_ th_ _is_strous _ff__ts of _ si_g_.

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
6. Th_r_for_ th_ skillful l____r su__u_s th_ _n_my's troops without _ny fighting; h_ __ptur_s th_ir _iti_s without l_ying si_g_ to th_m; h_ ov_rthrows th_ir king_om without l_ngthy op_r_tions in th_ fi_l_.

7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
7-1. With his for__s int__t h_ will _isput_ th_ m_st_ry of th_ _mpir_, _n_ thus, without losing _ m_n, his triumph will __ _ompl_t_.

7-2. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
7-2. This is th_ m_tho_ of _tt__king _y str_t_g_m.

8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
8. It is th_ rul_ in w_r, if our for__s _r_ t_n to th_ _n_my's on_, to surroun_ him; if fiv_ to on_, to _tt__k him; if twi__ _s num_rous, to _ivi__ our _rmy into two.

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
9. If _qu_lly m_t_h__, w_ __n off_r __ttl_; if slightly inf_rior in num__rs, w_ __n _voi_ th_ _n_my; if quit_ un_qu_l in _v_ry w_y, w_ __n fl__ from him.

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.
10. H_n__, though _n o_stin_t_ fight m_y __ m___ _y _ sm_ll for__, in th_ _n_ it must __ __ptur__ _y th_ l_rg_r for__.

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.
11. Now th_ g_n_r_l is th_ _ulw_rk of th_ St_t_; if th_ _ulw_rk is _ompl_t_ _t _ll points; th_ St_t_ will __ strong; if th_ _ulw_rk is __f__tiv_, th_ St_t_ will __ w__k.

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--
12. Th_r_ _r_ thr__ w_ys in whi_h _ rul_r __n _ring misfortun_ upon his _rmy:--

13-1. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.
13-1. (1) _y _omm_n_ing th_ _rmy to __v_n__ or to r_tr__t, __ing ignor_nt of th_ f__t th_t it __nnot o__y.

13-2. This is called hobbling the army.
13-2. This is __ll__ ho__ling th_ _rmy.

14-1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
14-1. (2) _y _tt_mpting to gov_rn _n _rmy in th_ s_m_ w_y _s h_ __minist_rs _ king_om, __ing ignor_nt of th_ _on_itions whi_h o_t_in in _n _rmy.

14-2. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.
14-2. This __us_s r_stl_ssn_ss in th_ sol_i_r's min_s.

15-1. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
15-1. (3) _y _mploying th_ offi__rs of his _rmy without _is_rimin_tion, through ignor_n__ of th_ milit_ry prin_ipl_ of ___pt_tion to _ir_umst_n__s.

15-2. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
15-2. This sh_k_s th_ _onfi__n__ of th_ sol_i_rs.

16-1. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes.
16-1. _ut wh_n th_ _rmy is r_stl_ss _n_ _istrustful, trou_l_ is sur_ to _om_ from th_ oth_r f_u__l prin__s.

16-2. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.
16-2. This is simply _ringing _n_r_hy into th_ _rmy, _n_ flinging vi_tory _w_y.

17-1. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
17-1. Thus w_ m_y know th_t th_r_ _r_ fiv_ _ss_nti_ls for vi_tory: (1) H_ will win who knows wh_n to fight _n_ wh_n not to fight.

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
17-2. (2) H_ will win who knows how to h_n_l_ _oth sup_rior _n_ inf_rior for__s.

17-3. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
17-3. (3) H_ will win whos_ _rmy is _nim_t__ _y th_ s_m_ spirit throughout _ll its r_nks.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.
17-4. (4) H_ will win who, pr_p_r__ hims_lf, w_its to t_k_ th_ _n_my unpr_p_r__.

17-5. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.
17-5. (5) H_ will win who h_s milit_ry __p__ity _n_ is not int_rf_r__ with _y th_ sov_r_ign.

18-1. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
18-1. H_n__ th_ s_ying: If you know th_ _n_my _n_ know yours_lf, you n___ not f__r th_ r_sult of _ hun_r__ __ttl_s.

18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
18-2. If you know yours_lf _ut not th_ _n_my, for _v_ry vi_tory g_in__ you will _lso suff_r _ __f__t.

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
18-3. If you know n_ith_r th_ _n_my nor yours_lf, you will su__um_ in _v_ry __ttl_.
