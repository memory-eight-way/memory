IV. T__TI__L _ISPOSITIONS

1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: Th_ goo_ fight_rs of ol_ first put th_ms_lv_s __yon_ th_ possi_ility of __f__t, _n_ th_n w_it__ for _n opportunity of __f__ting th_ _n_my.

2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
2. To s__ur_ ours_lv_s _g_inst __f__t li_s in our own h_n_s, _ut th_ opportunity of __f__ting th_ _n_my is provi___ _y th_ _n_my hims_lf.

3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
3. Thus th_ goo_ fight_r is __l_ to s__ur_ hims_lf _g_inst __f__t, _ut __nnot m_k_ __rt_in of __f__ting th_ _n_my.

4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
4. H_n__ th_ s_ying: On_ m_y know how to _onqu_r without __ing __l_ to _o it.

5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
5. S__urity _g_inst __f__t impli_s __f_nsiv_ t__ti_s; __ility to __f__t th_ _n_my m__ns t_king th_ off_nsiv_.

7-2. Thus on th_ on_ h_n_ w_ h_v_ __ility to prot__t ours_lv_s; on th_ oth_r, _ vi_tory th_t is _ompl_t_.

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
8. To s__ vi_tory only wh_n it is within th_ k_n of th_ _ommon h_r_ is not th_ __m_ of _x__ll_n__.

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
9. N_ith_r is it th_ __m_ of _x__ll_n__ if you fight _n_ _onqu_r _n_ th_ whol_ _mpir_ s_ys, "W_ll _on_!"

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
10. To lift _n _utumn h_ir is no sign of gr__t str_ngth; to s__ th_ sun _n_ moon is no sign of sh_rp sight; to h__r th_ nois_ of thun__r is no sign of _ qui_k __r.

13-1. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
13-1. H_ wins his __ttl_s _y m_king no mist_k_s.

13-2. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
13-2. M_king no mist_k_s is wh_t _st__lish_s th_ __rt_inty of vi_tory, for it m__ns _onqu_ring _n _n_my th_t is _lr___y __f__t__.

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
14. H_n__ th_ skillful fight_r puts hims_lf into _ position whi_h m_k_s __f__t impossi_l_, _n_ _o_s not miss th_ mom_nt for __f__ting th_ _n_my.

15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
15. Thus it is th_t in w_r th_ vi_torious str_t_gist only s__ks __ttl_ _ft_r th_ vi_tory h_s ___n won, wh_r__s h_ who is __stin__ to __f__t first fights _n_ _ft_rw_r_s looks for vi_tory.

18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
18. M__sur_m_nt ow_s its _xist_n__ to __rth; _stim_tion of qu_ntity to M__sur_m_nt; __l_ul_tion to _stim_tion of qu_ntity; __l_n_ing of _h_n__s to __l_ul_tion; _n_ Vi_tory to __l_n_ing of _h_n__s.
