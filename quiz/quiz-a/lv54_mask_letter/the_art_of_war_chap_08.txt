4. Th_ g_n_r_l who thoroughly un__rst_n_s th_ __v_nt_g_s th_t ___omp_ny v_ri_tion of t__ti_s knows how to h_n_l_ his troops.

5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.
5. Th_ g_n_r_l who _o_s not un__rst_n_ th_s_, m_y __ w_ll __qu_int__ with th_ _onfigur_tion of th_ _ountry, y_t h_ will not __ __l_ to turn his knowl__g_ to pr__ti__l ___ount.

6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.
6. So, th_ stu__nt of w_r who is unv_rs__ in th_ _rt of w_r of v_rying his pl_ns, _v_n though h_ __ __qu_int__ with th_ Fiv_ __v_nt_g_s, will f_il to m_k_ th_ __st us_ of his m_n.

7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.
7. H_n__ in th_ wis_ l____r's pl_ns, _onsi__r_tions of __v_nt_g_ _n_ of _is__v_nt_g_ will __ _l_n___ tog_th_r.

8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
8. If our _xp__t_tion of __v_nt_g_ __ t_mp_r__ in this w_y, w_ m_y su_____ in ___omplishing th_ _ss_nti_l p_rt of our s_h_m_s.

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.
9. If, on th_ oth_r h_n_, in th_ mi_st of _iffi_ulti_s w_ _r_ _lw_ys r___y to s_iz_ _n __v_nt_g_, w_ m_y _xtri__t_ ours_lv_s from misfortun_.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
11. Th_ _rt of w_r t___h_s us to r_ly not on th_ lik_lihoo_ of th_ _n_my's not _oming, _ut on our own r___in_ss to r___iv_ him; not on th_ _h_n__ of his not _tt__king, _ut r_th_r on th_ f__t th_t w_ h_v_ m___ our position un_ss_il__l_.

12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
12. Th_r_ _r_ fiv_ __ng_rous f_ults whi_h m_y _ff__t _ g_n_r_l: (1) R__kl_ssn_ss, whi_h l___s to __stru_tion; (2) _ow_r_i__, whi_h l___s to __ptur_; (3) _ h_sty t_mp_r, whi_h __n __ provok__ _y insults; (4) _ __li___y of honor whi_h is s_nsitiv_ to sh_m_; (5) ov_r-soli_itu__ for his m_n, whi_h _xpos_s him to worry _n_ trou_l_.
