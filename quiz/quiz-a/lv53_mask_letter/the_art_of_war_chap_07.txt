3-2. The _iffi_ulty of t__ti__l m_neuvering _onsists in turning the _evious into the _ire_t, _n_ misfortune into g_in.

4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.

7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.
7. Thus, if you or_er your men to roll up their _uff-_o_ts, _n_ m_ke for_e_ m_r_hes without h_lting __y or night, _overing _ou_le the usu_l _ist_n_e _t _ stret_h, _oing _ hun_re_ LI in or_er to wrest _n __v_nt_ge, the le__ers of _ll your three _ivisions will f_ll into the h_n_s of the enemy.
