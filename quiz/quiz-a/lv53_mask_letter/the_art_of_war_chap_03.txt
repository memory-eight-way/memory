III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM
III. _TT__K _Y STR_T_GEM

1-1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
1-1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In the pr__ti__l _rt of w_r, the _est thing of _ll is to t_ke the enemy's _ountry whole _n_ int__t; to sh_tter _n_ _estroy it is not so goo_.

1-2. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
1-2. So, too, it is _etter to re__pture _n _rmy entire th_n to _estroy it, to __pture _ regiment, _ _et__hment or _ _omp_ny entire th_n to _estroy them.

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
2. Hen_e to fight _n_ _onquer in _ll your __ttles is not supreme ex_ellen_e; supreme ex_ellen_e _onsists in _re_king the enemy's resist_n_e without fighting.

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
3. Thus the highest form of gener_lship is to __lk the enemy's pl_ns; the next _est is to prevent the jun_tion of the enemy's for_es; the next in or_er is to _tt__k the enemy's _rmy in the fiel_; _n_ the worst poli_y of _ll is to _esiege w_lle_ _ities.

4-1. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.
4-1. The rule is, not to _esiege w_lle_ _ities if it __n possi_ly _e _voi_e_.

4-2. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.
4-2. The prep_r_tion of m_ntlets, mov__le shelters, _n_ v_rious implements of w_r, will t_ke up three whole months; _n_ the piling up of moun_s over _g_inst the w_lls will t_ke three months more.

5-1. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.
5-1. The gener_l, un__le to _ontrol his irrit_tion, will l_un_h his men to the _ss_ult like sw_rming _nts, with the result th_t one-thir_ of his men _re sl_in, while the town still rem_ins unt_ken.

5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
5-2. Su_h _re the _is_strous effe_ts of _ siege.

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
6. Therefore the skillful le__er su__ues the enemy's troops without _ny fighting; he __ptures their _ities without l_ying siege to them; he overthrows their king_om without lengthy oper_tions in the fiel_.

7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
7-1. With his for_es int__t he will _ispute the m_stery of the Empire, _n_ thus, without losing _ m_n, his triumph will _e _omplete.

7-2. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
7-2. This is the metho_ of _tt__king _y str_t_gem.

8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
8. It is the rule in w_r, if our for_es _re ten to the enemy's one, to surroun_ him; if five to one, to _tt__k him; if twi_e _s numerous, to _ivi_e our _rmy into two.

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
9. If equ_lly m_t_he_, we __n offer __ttle; if slightly inferior in num_ers, we __n _voi_ the enemy; if quite unequ_l in every w_y, we __n flee from him.

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.
10. Hen_e, though _n o_stin_te fight m_y _e m__e _y _ sm_ll for_e, in the en_ it must _e __pture_ _y the l_rger for_e.

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.
11. Now the gener_l is the _ulw_rk of the St_te; if the _ulw_rk is _omplete _t _ll points; the St_te will _e strong; if the _ulw_rk is _efe_tive, the St_te will _e we_k.

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--
12. There _re three w_ys in whi_h _ ruler __n _ring misfortune upon his _rmy:--

13-1. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.
13-1. (1) _y _omm_n_ing the _rmy to __v_n_e or to retre_t, _eing ignor_nt of the f__t th_t it __nnot o_ey.

13-2. This is called hobbling the army.
13-2. This is __lle_ ho__ling the _rmy.

14-1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
14-1. (2) _y _ttempting to govern _n _rmy in the s_me w_y _s he __ministers _ king_om, _eing ignor_nt of the _on_itions whi_h o_t_in in _n _rmy.

14-2. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.
14-2. This __uses restlessness in the sol_ier's min_s.

15-1. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
15-1. (3) _y employing the offi_ers of his _rmy without _is_rimin_tion, through ignor_n_e of the milit_ry prin_iple of ___pt_tion to _ir_umst_n_es.

15-2. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
15-2. This sh_kes the _onfi_en_e of the sol_iers.

16-1. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes.
16-1. _ut when the _rmy is restless _n_ _istrustful, trou_le is sure to _ome from the other feu__l prin_es.

16-2. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.
16-2. This is simply _ringing _n_r_hy into the _rmy, _n_ flinging vi_tory _w_y.

17-1. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
17-1. Thus we m_y know th_t there _re five essenti_ls for vi_tory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight _n_ when not to fight.

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to h_n_le _oth superior _n_ inferior for_es.

17-3. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
17-3. (3) He will win whose _rmy is _nim_te_ _y the s_me spirit throughout _ll its r_nks.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.

17-5. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.
17-5. (5) He will win who h_s milit_ry __p__ity _n_ is not interfere_ with _y the sovereign.

18-1. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
18-1. Hen_e the s_ying: If you know the enemy _n_ know yourself, you nee_ not fe_r the result of _ hun_re_ __ttles.

18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
18-2. If you know yourself _ut not the enemy, for every vi_tory g_ine_ you will _lso suffer _ _efe_t.

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will su__um_ in every __ttle.
