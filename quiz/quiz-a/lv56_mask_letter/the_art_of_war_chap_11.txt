XI. TH_ NIN_ SITU_TIONS

1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: Th_ _rt o_ w_r r__o_niz_s nin_ v_ri_ti_s o_ _roun_: (1) _isp_rsiv_ _roun_; (2) ___il_ _roun_; (3) _ont_ntious _roun_; (4) op_n _roun_; (5) _roun_ o_ int_rs__tin_ hi_hw_ys; (6) s_rious _roun_; (7) _i__i_ult _roun_; (8) h_mm__-in _roun_; (9) __sp_r_t_ _roun_.

2. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.
2. Wh_n _ _hi__t_in is _i_htin_ in his own t_rritory, it is _isp_rsiv_ _roun_.

7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.
7. Wh_n _n _rmy h_s p_n_tr_t__ into th_ h__rt o_ _ hostil_ _ountry, l__vin_ _ num__r o_ _orti_i__ _iti_s in its r__r, it is s_rious _roun_.

8. Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens-- all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.
8. Mount_in _or_sts, ru____ st__ps, m_rsh_s _n_ __ns-- _ll _ountry th_t is h_r_ to tr_v_rs_: this is _i__i_ult _roun_.

9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.
9. _roun_ whi_h is r___h__ throu_h n_rrow _or__s, _n_ _rom whi_h w_ __n only r_tir_ _y tortuous p_ths, so th_t _ sm_ll num__r o_ th_ _n_my woul_ su__i__ to _rush _ l_r__ _o_y o_ our m_n: this is h_mm__ in _roun_.

10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.
10. _roun_ on whi_h w_ __n only __ s_v__ _rom __stru_tion _y _i_htin_ without __l_y, is __sp_r_t_ _roun_.

19. Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.
19. R_pi_ity is th_ _ss_n__ o_ w_r: t_k_ __v_nt___ o_ th_ _n_my's unr___in_ss, m_k_ your w_y _y un_xp__t__ rout_s, _n_ _tt__k un_u_r___ spots.

30-1. _sk__ i_ _n _rmy __n __ m___ to imit_t_ th_ shu_i-j_n, I shoul_ _nsw_r, Y_s.

30-2. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.
30-2. _or th_ m_n o_ Wu _n_ th_ m_n o_ Yu_h _r_ _n_mi_s; y_t i_ th_y _r_ _rossin_ _ riv_r in th_ s_m_ _o_t _n_ _r_ __u_ht _y _ storm, th_y will _om_ to ___h oth_r's _ssist_n__ just _s th_ l__t h_n_ h_lps th_ ri_ht.

31. H_n__ it is not _nou_h to put on_'s trust in th_ t_th_rin_ o_ hors_s, _n_ th_ _uryin_ o_ _h_riot wh__ls in th_ _roun_.

32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.
