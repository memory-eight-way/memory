VIII. V_RI_TION IN T__TI_S

1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In w_r, th_ __n_r_l r___iv_s his _omm_n_s _rom th_ sov_r_i_n, _oll__ts his _rmy _n_ _on__ntr_t_s his _or__s.

4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.
4. Th_ __n_r_l who thorou_hly un__rst_n_s th_ __v_nt___s th_t ___omp_ny v_ri_tion o_ t__ti_s knows how to h_n_l_ his troops.

5. Th_ __n_r_l who _o_s not un__rst_n_ th_s_, m_y __ w_ll __qu_int__ with th_ _on_i_ur_tion o_ th_ _ountry, y_t h_ will not __ __l_ to turn his knowl____ to pr__ti__l ___ount.

6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.
6. So, th_ stu__nt o_ w_r who is unv_rs__ in th_ _rt o_ w_r o_ v_ryin_ his pl_ns, _v_n thou_h h_ __ __qu_int__ with th_ _iv_ __v_nt___s, will __il to m_k_ th_ __st us_ o_ his m_n.

7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.
7. H_n__ in th_ wis_ l____r's pl_ns, _onsi__r_tions o_ __v_nt___ _n_ o_ _is__v_nt___ will __ _l_n___ to__th_r.

8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
8. I_ our _xp__t_tion o_ __v_nt___ __ t_mp_r__ in this w_y, w_ m_y su_____ in ___omplishin_ th_ _ss_nti_l p_rt o_ our s_h_m_s.

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.
9. I_, on th_ oth_r h_n_, in th_ mi_st o_ _i__i_ulti_s w_ _r_ _lw_ys r___y to s_iz_ _n __v_nt___, w_ m_y _xtri__t_ ours_lv_s _rom mis_ortun_.

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
11. Th_ _rt o_ w_r t___h_s us to r_ly not on th_ lik_lihoo_ o_ th_ _n_my's not _omin_, _ut on our own r___in_ss to r___iv_ him; not on th_ _h_n__ o_ his not _tt__kin_, _ut r_th_r on th_ ___t th_t w_ h_v_ m___ our position un_ss_il__l_.

12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
12. Th_r_ _r_ _iv_ __n__rous __ults whi_h m_y _____t _ __n_r_l: (1) R__kl_ssn_ss, whi_h l___s to __stru_tion; (2) _ow_r_i__, whi_h l___s to __ptur_; (3) _ h_sty t_mp_r, whi_h __n __ provok__ _y insults; (4) _ __li___y o_ honor whi_h is s_nsitiv_ to sh_m_; (5) ov_r-soli_itu__ _or his m_n, whi_h _xpos_s him to worry _n_ trou_l_.
