X. TERRAIN
X. T_RR_IN

1. Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1) Accessible ground; (2) entangling ground; (3) temporizing ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: W_ m_y _istin_uish six kin_s o_ t_rr_in, to wit: (1) ____ssi_l_ _roun_; (2) _nt_n_lin_ _roun_; (3) t_mporizin_ _roun_; (4) n_rrow p_ss_s; (5) pr__ipitous h_i_hts; (6) positions _t _ _r__t _ist_n__ _rom th_ _n_my.

2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.
2. _roun_ whi_h __n __ _r__ly tr_v_rs__ _y _oth si__s is __ll__ ____ssi_l_.

3-1. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies.
3-1. With r___r_ to _roun_ o_ this n_tur_, __ ___or_ th_ _n_my in o__upyin_ th_ r_is__ _n_ sunny spots, _n_ __r__ully _u_r_ your lin_ o_ suppli_s.

3-2. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.
3-2. Th_n you will __ __l_ to _i_ht with __v_nt___.

4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.
4. _roun_ whi_h __n __ ___n_on__ _ut is h_r_ to r_-o__upy is __ll__ _nt_n_lin_.

5-1. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him.
5-1. _rom _ position o_ this sort, i_ th_ _n_my is unpr_p_r__, you m_y s_lly _orth _n_ _____t him.

5-2. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.
5-2. _ut i_ th_ _n_my is pr_p_r__ _or your _omin_, _n_ you __il to _____t him, th_n, r_turn __in_ impossi_l_, _is_st_r will _nsu_.

6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.
6. Wh_n th_ position is su_h th_t n_ith_r si__ will __in _y m_kin_ th_ _irst mov_, it is __ll__ t_mporizin_ _roun_.

7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.
7. In _ position o_ this sort, _v_n thou_h th_ _n_my shoul_ o___r us _n _ttr__tiv_ __it, it will __ __vis__l_ not to stir _orth, _ut r_th_r to r_tr__t, thus _nti_in_ th_ _n_my in his turn; th_n, wh_n p_rt o_ his _rmy h_s _om_ out, w_ m_y __liv_r our _tt__k with __v_nt___.

8. With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.
8. With r___r_ to n_rrow p_ss_s, i_ you __n o__upy th_m _irst, l_t th_m __ stron_ly __rrison__ _n_ _w_it th_ __v_nt o_ th_ _n_my.

9. Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.
9. Shoul_ th_ _rmy _or_st_ll you in o__upyin_ _ p_ss, _o not _o __t_r him i_ th_ p_ss is _ully __rrison__, _ut only i_ it is w__kly __rrison__.

10. With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.
10. With r___r_ to pr__ipitous h_i_hts, i_ you _r_ ___or_h_n_ with your __v_rs_ry, you shoul_ o__upy th_ r_is__ _n_ sunny spots, _n_ th_r_ w_it _or him to _om_ up.

11. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.
11. I_ th_ _n_my h_s o__upi__ th_m ___or_ you, _o not _ollow him, _ut r_tr__t _n_ try to _nti__ him _w_y.

12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.
12. I_ you _r_ situ_t__ _t _ _r__t _ist_n__ _rom th_ _n_my, _n_ th_ str_n_th o_ th_ two _rmi_s is _qu_l, it is not __sy to provok_ _ __ttl_, _n_ _i_htin_ will __ to your _is__v_nt___.

13-1. These six are the principles connected with Earth.
13-1. Th_s_ six _r_ th_ prin_ipl_s _onn__t__ with __rth.

13-2. Th_ __n_r_l who h_s _tt_in__ _ r_sponsi_l_ post must __ __r__ul to stu_y th_m.

14-1. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.
14-1. Now _n _rmy is _xpos__ to six s_v_r_l __l_miti_s, not _risin_ _rom n_tur_l __us_s, _ut _rom __ults _or whi_h th_ __n_r_l is r_sponsi_l_.

14-2. These are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5) disorganization; (6) rout.
14-2. Th_s_ _r_: (1) _li_ht; (2) insu_or_in_tion; (3) _oll_ps_; (4) ruin; (5) _isor__niz_tion; (6) rout.

15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.
15. Oth_r _on_itions __in_ _qu_l, i_ on_ _or__ is hurl__ ___inst _noth_r t_n tim_s its siz_, th_ r_sult will __ th_ _li_ht o_ th_ _orm_r.

16-1. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination.
16-1. Wh_n th_ _ommon sol_i_rs _r_ too stron_ _n_ th_ir o__i__rs too w__k, th_ r_sult is insu_or_in_tion.

16-2. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.
16-2. Wh_n th_ o__i__rs _r_ too stron_ _n_ th_ _ommon sol_i_rs too w__k, th_ r_sult is _oll_ps_.

17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.
17. Wh_n th_ hi_h_r o__i__rs _r_ _n_ry _n_ insu_or_in_t_, _n_ on m__tin_ th_ _n_my _iv_ __ttl_ on th_ir own ___ount _rom _ ___lin_ o_ r_s_ntm_nt, ___or_ th_ _omm_n__r-in-_hi__ __n t_ll wh_th_r or not h_ is in _ position to _i_ht, th_ r_sult is ruin.

18. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.
18. Wh_n th_ __n_r_l is w__k _n_ without _uthority; wh_n his or__rs _r_ not _l__r _n_ _istin_t; wh_n th_r_ _r_ no _ix_s _uti_s _ssi_n__ to o__i__rs _n_ m_n, _n_ th_ r_nks _r_ _orm__ in _ slov_nly h_ph_z_r_ m_nn_r, th_ r_sult is utt_r _isor__niz_tion.

19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.
19. Wh_n _ __n_r_l, un__l_ to _stim_t_ th_ _n_my's str_n_th, _llows _n in__rior _or__ to _n____ _ l_r__r on_, or hurls _ w__k __t__hm_nt ___inst _ pow_r_ul on_, _n_ n__l__ts to pl___ pi_k__ sol_i_rs in th_ _ront r_nk, th_ r_sult must __ rout.

20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.
20. Th_s_ _r_ six w_ys o_ _ourtin_ _____t, whi_h must __ __r__ully not__ _y th_ __n_r_l who h_s _tt_in__ _ r_sponsi_l_ post.

21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.
21. Th_ n_tur_l _orm_tion o_ th_ _ountry is th_ sol_i_r's __st _lly; _ut _ pow_r o_ _stim_tin_ th_ __v_rs_ry, o_ _ontrollin_ th_ _or__s o_ vi_tory, _n_ o_ shr_w_ly __l_ul_tin_ _i__i_ulti_s, __n__rs _n_ _ist_n__s, _onstitut_s th_ t_st o_ _ _r__t __n_r_l.

22-1. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles.
22-1. H_ who knows th_s_ thin_s, _n_ in _i_htin_ puts his knowl____ into pr__ti__, will win his __ttl_s.

22-2. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.
22-2. H_ who knows th_m not, nor pr__ti__s th_m, will sur_ly __ _____t__.

23. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.
23. I_ _i_htin_ is sur_ to r_sult in vi_tory, th_n you must _i_ht, _v_n thou_h th_ rul_r _or_i_ it; i_ _i_htin_ will not r_sult in vi_tory, th_n you must not _i_ht _v_n _t th_ rul_r's _i__in_.

24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.
24. Th_ __n_r_l who __v_n__s without _ov_tin_ __m_ _n_ r_tr__ts without ___rin_ _is_r___, whos_ only thou_ht is to prot__t his _ountry _n_ _o _oo_ s_rvi__ _or his sov_r_i_n, is th_ j_w_l o_ th_ kin__om.

25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.
25. R___r_ your sol_i_rs _s your _hil_r_n, _n_ th_y will _ollow you into th_ ___p_st v_ll_ys; look upon th_m _s your own __lov__ sons, _n_ th_y will st_n_ _y you _v_n unto ___th.

26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.
26. I_, how_v_r, you _r_ in_ul__nt, _ut un__l_ to m_k_ your _uthority __lt; kin_-h__rt__, _ut un__l_ to _n_or__ your _omm_n_s; _n_ in__p__l_, mor_ov_r, o_ qu_llin_ _isor__r: th_n your sol_i_rs must __ lik_n__ to spoilt _hil_r_n; th_y _r_ us_l_ss _or _ny pr__ti__l purpos_.

27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.
27. I_ w_ know th_t our own m_n _r_ in _ _on_ition to _tt__k, _ut _r_ un_w_r_ th_t th_ _n_my is not op_n to _tt__k, w_ h_v_ _on_ only h_l_w_y tow_r_s vi_tory.

28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.
28. I_ w_ know th_t th_ _n_my is op_n to _tt__k, _ut _r_ un_w_r_ th_t our own m_n _r_ not in _ _on_ition to _tt__k, w_ h_v_ _on_ only h_l_w_y tow_r_s vi_tory.

29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.
29. I_ w_ know th_t th_ _n_my is op_n to _tt__k, _n_ _lso know th_t our m_n _r_ in _ _on_ition to _tt__k, _ut _r_ un_w_r_ th_t th_ n_tur_ o_ th_ _roun_ m_k_s _i_htin_ impr__ti___l_, w_ h_v_ still _on_ only h_l_w_y tow_r_s vi_tory.

30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.
30. H_n__ th_ _xp_ri_n___ sol_i_r, on__ in motion, is n_v_r __wil__r__; on__ h_ h_s _rok_n __mp, h_ is n_v_r _t _ loss.

31. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.
31. H_n__ th_ s_yin_: I_ you know th_ _n_my _n_ know yours_l_, your vi_tory will not st_n_ in _ou_t; i_ you know H__v_n _n_ know __rth, you m_y m_k_ your vi_tory _ompl_t_.
