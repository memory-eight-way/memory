VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG
VI. W__K POINTS _N_ STRON_


1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: Who_v_r is _irst in th_ _i_l_ _n_ _w_its th_ _omin_ o_ th_ _n_my, will __ _r_sh _or th_ _i_ht; who_v_r is s__on_ in th_ _i_l_ _n_ h_s to h_st_n to __ttl_ will _rriv_ _xh_ust__.

2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
2. Th_r__or_ th_ _l_v_r _om__t_nt impos_s his will on th_ _n_my, _ut _o_s not _llow th_ _n_my's will to __ impos__ on him.

3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.
3. _y hol_in_ out __v_nt___s to him, h_ __n __us_ th_ _n_my to _ppro__h o_ his own ___or_; or, _y in_li_tin_ __m___, h_ __n m_k_ it impossi_l_ _or th_ _n_my to _r_w n__r.

4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.
4. I_ th_ _n_my is t_kin_ his __s_, h_ __n h_r_ss him; i_ w_ll suppli__ with _oo_, h_ __n st_rv_ him out; i_ qui_tly _n__mp__, h_ __n _or__ him to mov_.

5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.
5. _pp__r _t points whi_h th_ _n_my must h_st_n to ____n_; m_r_h swi_tly to pl___s wh_r_ you _r_ not _xp__t__.

6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.
6. _n _rmy m_y m_r_h _r__t _ist_n__s without _istr_ss, i_ it m_r_h_s throu_h _ountry wh_r_ th_ _n_my is not.

7-1. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.
7-1. You __n __ sur_ o_ su_____in_ in your _tt__ks i_ you only _tt__k pl___s whi_h _r_ un____n___.

7-2. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.
7-2. You __n _nsur_ th_ s___ty o_ your ____ns_ i_ you only hol_ positions th_t __nnot __ _tt__k__.

8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
8. H_n__ th_t __n_r_l is skill_ul in _tt__k whos_ oppon_nt _o_s not know wh_t to ____n_; _n_ h_ is skill_ul in ____ns_ whos_ oppon_nt _o_s not know wh_t to _tt__k.

9-1. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!
9-1. O _ivin_ _rt o_ su_tl_ty _n_ s__r__y!

9-2. Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
9-2. Throu_h you w_ l__rn to __ invisi_l_, throu_h you in_u_i_l_; _n_ h_n__ w_ __n hol_ th_ _n_my's __t_ in our h_n_s.

10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
10. You m_y __v_n__ _n_ __ __solut_ly irr_sisti_l_, i_ you m_k_ _or th_ _n_my's w__k points; you m_y r_tir_ _n_ __ s___ _rom pursuit i_ your mov_m_nts _r_ mor_ r_pi_ th_n thos_ o_ th_ _n_my.

11-1. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch.
11-1. I_ w_ wish to _i_ht, th_ _n_my __n __ _or___ to _n _n____m_nt _v_n thou_h h_ __ sh_lt_r__ __hin_ _ hi_h r_mp_rt _n_ _ ___p _it_h.

11-2. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
11-2. _ll w_ n___ _o is _tt__k som_ oth_r pl___ th_t h_ will __ o_li___ to r_li_v_.

12-1. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.
12-1. I_ w_ _o not wish to _i_ht, w_ __n pr_v_nt th_ _n_my _rom _n___in_ us _v_n thou_h th_ lin_s o_ our _n__mpm_nt __ m_r_ly tr____ out on th_ _roun_.

12-2. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.
12-2. _ll w_ n___ _o is to throw som_thin_ o__ _n_ un___ount__l_ in his w_y.

13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.
13. _y _is_ov_rin_ th_ _n_my's _ispositions _n_ r_m_inin_ invisi_l_ ours_lv_s, w_ __n k__p our _or__s _on__ntr_t__, whil_ th_ _n_my's must __ _ivi___.

14-1. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions.
14-1. W_ __n _orm _ sin_l_ unit__ _o_y, whil_ th_ _n_my must split up into _r__tions.

14-2. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
14-2. H_n__ th_r_ will __ _ whol_ pitt__ ___inst s_p_r_t_ p_rts o_ _ whol_, whi_h m__ns th_t w_ sh_ll __ m_ny to th_ _n_my's __w.

15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
15. _n_ i_ w_ _r_ __l_ thus to _tt__k _n in__rior _or__ with _ sup_rior on_, our oppon_nts will __ in _ir_ str_its.

16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.
16. Th_ spot wh_r_ w_ int_n_ to _i_ht must not __ m___ known; _or th_n th_ _n_my will h_v_ to pr_p_r_ ___inst _ possi_l_ _tt__k _t s_v_r_l _i___r_nt points; _n_ his _or__s __in_ thus _istri_ut__ in m_ny _ir__tions, th_ num__rs w_ sh_ll h_v_ to ____ _t _ny _iv_n point will __ proportion_t_ly __w.

17-1. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.
17-1. _or shoul_ th_ _n_my str_n_th_n his v_n, h_ will w__k_n his r__r; shoul_ h_ str_n_th_n his r__r, h_ will w__k_n his v_n; shoul_ h_ str_n_th_n his l__t, h_ will w__k_n his ri_ht; shoul_ h_ str_n_th_n his ri_ht, h_ will w__k_n his l__t.

17-2. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.
17-2. I_ h_ s_n_s r_in_or__m_nts _v_rywh_r_, h_ will _v_rywh_r_ __ w__k.

18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.
18. Num_ri__l w__kn_ss _om_s _rom h_vin_ to pr_p_r_ ___inst possi_l_ _tt__ks; num_ri__l str_n_th, _rom _omp_llin_ our __v_rs_ry to m_k_ th_s_ pr_p_r_tions ___inst us.

19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.
19. Knowin_ th_ pl___ _n_ th_ tim_ o_ th_ _omin_ __ttl_, w_ m_y _on__ntr_t_ _rom th_ _r__t_st _ist_n__s in or__r to _i_ht.

20-1. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van.
20-1. _ut i_ n_ith_r tim_ nor pl___ __ known, th_n th_ l__t win_ will __ impot_nt to su__or th_ ri_ht, th_ ri_ht _qu_lly impot_nt to su__or th_ l__t, th_ v_n un__l_ to r_li_v_ th_ r__r, or th_ r__r to support th_ v_n.

20-2. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!
20-2. How mu_h mor_ so i_ th_ _urth_st portions o_ th_ _rmy _r_ _nythin_ un__r _ hun_r__ LI _p_rt, _n_ _v_n th_ n__r_st _r_ s_p_r_t__ _y s_v_r_l LI!

21-1. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.
21-1. Thou_h ___or_in_ to my _stim_t_ th_ sol_i_rs o_ Yu_h _x____ our own in num__r, th_t sh_ll __v_nt___ th_m nothin_ in th_ m_tt_r o_ vi_tory.

21-2. I say then that victory can be achieved.
21-2. I s_y th_n th_t vi_tory __n __ __hi_v__.

22-1. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting.
22-1. Thou_h th_ _n_my __ stron__r in num__rs, w_ m_y pr_v_nt him _rom _i_htin_.

22-2. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.
22-2. S_h_m_ so _s to _is_ov_r his pl_ns _n_ th_ lik_lihoo_ o_ th_ir su___ss.

23-1. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.
23-1. Rous_ him, _n_ l__rn th_ prin_ipl_ o_ his __tivity or in__tivity.

23-2. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.
23-2. _or__ him to r_v__l hims_l_, so _s to _in_ out his vuln_r__l_ spots.

24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.
24. __r__ully _omp_r_ th_ opposin_ _rmy with your own, so th_t you m_y know wh_r_ str_n_th is sup_r__un__nt _n_ wh_r_ it is ___i_i_nt.

25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.
25. In m_kin_ t__ti__l _ispositions, th_ hi_h_st pit_h you __n _tt_in is to _on___l th_m; _on___l your _ispositions, _n_ you will __ s___ _rom th_ pryin_ o_ th_ su_tl_st spi_s, _rom th_ m__hin_tions o_ th_ wis_st _r_ins.

26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics-- that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
26. How vi_tory m_y __ pro_u___ _or th_m out o_ th_ _n_my's own t__ti_s-- th_t is wh_t th_ multitu__ __nnot _ompr_h_n_.

27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
27. _ll m_n __n s__ th_ t__ti_s wh_r__y I _onqu_r, _ut wh_t non_ __n s__ is th_ str_t__y out o_ whi_h vi_tory is _volv__.
28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
28. _o not r_p__t th_ t__ti_s whi_h h_v_ __in__ you on_ vi_tory, _ut l_t your m_tho_s __ r__ul_t__ _y th_ in_init_ v_ri_ty o_ _ir_umst_n__s.

29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
29. Milit_ry t__ti_s _r_ lik_ unto w_t_r; _or w_t_r in its n_tur_l _ours_ runs _w_y _rom hi_h pl___s _n_ h_st_ns _ownw_r_s.

30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.
30. So in w_r, th_ w_y is to _voi_ wh_t is stron_ _n_ to strik_ _t wh_t is w__k.

31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
31. W_t_r sh_p_s its _ours_ ___or_in_ to th_ n_tur_ o_ th_ _roun_ ov_r whi_h it _lows; th_ sol_i_r works out his vi_tory in r_l_tion to th_ _o_ whom h_ is ___in_.

32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.
32. Th_r__or_, just _s w_t_r r_t_ins no _onst_nt sh_p_, so in w_r__r_ th_r_ _r_ no _onst_nt _on_itions.

33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.
33. H_ who __n mo_i_y his t__ti_s in r_l_tion to his oppon_nt _n_ th_r__y su_____ in winnin_, m_y __ __ll__ _ h__v_n-_orn __pt_in.

34-1. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn.
34-1. Th_ _iv_ _l_m_nts (w_t_r, _ir_, woo_, m_t_l, __rth) _r_ not _lw_ys _qu_lly pr__omin_nt; th_ _our s__sons m_k_ w_y _or ___h oth_r in turn.

34-2. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.
34-2. Th_r_ _r_ short __ys _n_ lon_; th_ moon h_s its p_rio_s o_ w_nin_ _n_ w_xin_.
