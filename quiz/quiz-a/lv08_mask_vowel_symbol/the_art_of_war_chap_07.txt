3-2. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.
3-2. Th_ d_ff_c_lty _f t_ct_c_l m_n__v_r_ng c_ns_sts _n t_rn_ng th_ d_v___s _nt_ th_ d_r_ct_ _nd m_sf_rt_n_ _nt_ g__n_

4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.
4. Th_s_ t_ t_k_ _ l_ng _nd c_rc__t__s r__t__ _ft_r _nt_c_ng th_ _n_my __t _f th_ w_y_ _nd th__gh st_rt_ng _ft_r h_m_ t_ c_ntr_v_ t_ r__ch th_ g__l b_f_r_ h_m_ sh_ws kn_wl_dg_ _f th_ _rt_f_c_ _f D_V__T__N_

7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.
7. Th_s_ _f y__ _rd_r y__r m_n t_ r_ll _p th__r b_ff_c__ts_ _nd m_k_ f_rc_d m_rch_s w_th__t h_lt_ng d_y _r n_ght_ c_v_r_ng d__bl_ th_ _s__l d_st_nc_ _t _ str_tch_ d__ng _ h_ndr_d L_ _n _rd_r t_ wr_st _n _dv_nt_g__ th_ l__d_rs _f _ll y__r thr__ d_v_s__ns w_ll f_ll _nt_ th_ h_nds _f th_ _n_my_

9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.
9. _f y__ m_rch f_fty L_ _n _rd_r t_ __tm_n__v_r th_ _n_my_ y__ w_ll l_s_ th_ l__d_r _f y__r f_rst d_v_s__n_ _nd _nly h_lf y__r f_rc_ w_ll r__ch th_ g__l_

10. _f y__ m_rch th_rty L_ w_th th_ s_m_ _bj_ct_ tw__th_rds _f y__r _rmy w_ll _rr_v__

11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.

14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.

18. In raiding and plundering be like fire, in immovability like a mountain.

20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.

23-2. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.

25-1. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.

28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.
28. N_w _ s_ld__r_s sp_r_t _s k__n_st _n th_ m_rn_ng_ by n__nd_y _t h_s b_g_n t_ fl_g_ _nd _n th_ _v_n_ng_ h_s m_nd _s b_nt _nly _n r_t_rn_ng t_ c_mp_

31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:-- this is the art of husbanding one's strength.
