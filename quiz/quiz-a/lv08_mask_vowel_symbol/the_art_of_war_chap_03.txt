III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM
III. _TT_CK BY STR_T_G_M

1-1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
1-1. S_n Tz_ s__d_ _n th_ pr_ct_c_l _rt _f w_r_ th_ b_st th_ng _f _ll _s t_ t_k_ th_ _n_my_s c__ntry wh_l_ _nd _nt_ct_ t_ sh_tt_r _nd d_str_y _t _s n_t s_ g__d_

1-2. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
1-2. S__ t___ _t _s b_tt_r t_ r_c_pt_r_ _n _rmy _nt_r_ th_n t_ d_str_y _t_ t_ c_pt_r_ _ r_g_m_nt_ _ d_t_chm_nt _r _ c_mp_ny _nt_r_ th_n t_ d_str_y th_m_

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
2. H_nc_ t_ f_ght _nd c_nq__r _n _ll y__r b_ttl_s _s n_t s_pr_m_ _xc_ll_nc__ s_pr_m_ _xc_ll_nc_ c_ns_sts _n br__k_ng th_ _n_my_s r_s_st_nc_ w_th__t f_ght_ng_

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
3. Th_s th_ h_gh_st f_rm _f g_n_r_lsh_p _s t_ b_lk th_ _n_my_s pl_ns_ th_ n_xt b_st _s t_ pr_v_nt th_ j_nct__n _f th_ _n_my_s f_rc_s_ th_ n_xt _n _rd_r _s t_ _tt_ck th_ _n_my_s _rmy _n th_ f__ld_ _nd th_ w_rst p_l_cy _f _ll _s t_ b_s__g_ w_ll_d c_t__s_

4-1. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.
4-1. Th_ r_l_ _s_ n_t t_ b_s__g_ w_ll_d c_t__s _f _t c_n p_ss_bly b_ _v__d_d_

4-2. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.
4-2. Th_ pr_p_r_t__n _f m_ntl_ts_ m_v_bl_ sh_lt_rs_ _nd v_r___s _mpl_m_nts _f w_r_ w_ll t_k_ _p thr__ wh_l_ m_nths_ _nd th_ p_l_ng _p _f m__nds _v_r _g__nst th_ w_lls w_ll t_k_ thr__ m_nths m_r__

5-1. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.
5-1. Th_ g_n_r_l_ _n_bl_ t_ c_ntr_l h_s _rr_t_t__n_ w_ll l__nch h_s m_n t_ th_ _ss__lt l_k_ sw_rm_ng _nts_ w_th th_ r_s_lt th_t _n__th_rd _f h_s m_n _r_ sl__n_ wh_l_ th_ t_wn st_ll r_m__ns _nt_k_n_

5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
5-2. S_ch _r_ th_ d_s_str__s _ff_cts _f _ s__g__

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
6. Th_r_f_r_ th_ sk_llf_l l__d_r s_bd__s th_ _n_my_s tr__ps w_th__t _ny f_ght_ng_ h_ c_pt_r_s th__r c_t__s w_th__t l_y_ng s__g_ t_ th_m_ h_ _v_rthr_ws th__r k_ngd_m w_th__t l_ngthy _p_r_t__ns _n th_ f__ld_

7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
7-1. W_th h_s f_rc_s _nt_ct h_ w_ll d_sp_t_ th_ m_st_ry _f th_ _mp_r__ _nd th_s_ w_th__t l_s_ng _ m_n_ h_s tr__mph w_ll b_ c_mpl_t__

7-2. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
7-2. Th_s _s th_ m_th_d _f _tt_ck_ng by str_t_g_m_

8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
8. _t _s th_ r_l_ _n w_r_ _f __r f_rc_s _r_ t_n t_ th_ _n_my_s _n__ t_ s_rr__nd h_m_ _f f_v_ t_ _n__ t_ _tt_ck h_m_ _f tw_c_ _s n_m_r__s_ t_ d_v_d_ __r _rmy _nt_ tw__

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
9. _f _q__lly m_tch_d_ w_ c_n _ff_r b_ttl__ _f sl_ghtly _nf_r__r _n n_mb_rs_ w_ c_n _v__d th_ _n_my_ _f q__t_ _n_q__l _n _v_ry w_y_ w_ c_n fl__ fr_m h_m_

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.
11. N_w th_ g_n_r_l _s th_ b_lw_rk _f th_ St_t__ _f th_ b_lw_rk _s c_mpl_t_ _t _ll p__nts_ th_ St_t_ w_ll b_ str_ng_ _f th_ b_lw_rk _s d_f_ct_v__ th_ St_t_ w_ll b_ w__k_

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--
12. Th_r_ _r_ thr__ w_ys _n wh_ch _ r_l_r c_n br_ng m_sf_rt_n_ _p_n h_s _rmy___

13-1. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.
13-1. _1_ By c_mm_nd_ng th_ _rmy t_ _dv_nc_ _r t_ r_tr__t_ b__ng _gn_r_nt _f th_ f_ct th_t _t c_nn_t _b_y_

13-2. This is called hobbling the army.
13-2. Th_s _s c_ll_d h_bbl_ng th_ _rmy_

14-1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
14-1. _2_ By _tt_mpt_ng t_ g_v_rn _n _rmy _n th_ s_m_ w_y _s h_ _dm_n_st_rs _ k_ngd_m_ b__ng _gn_r_nt _f th_ c_nd_t__ns wh_ch _bt__n _n _n _rmy_

14-2. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.
14-2. Th_s c__s_s r_stl_ssn_ss _n th_ s_ld__r_s m_nds_

15-1. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
15-1. _3_ By _mpl_y_ng th_ _ff_c_rs _f h_s _rmy w_th__t d_scr_m_n_t__n_ thr__gh _gn_r_nc_ _f th_ m_l_t_ry pr_nc_pl_ _f _d_pt_t__n t_ c_rc_mst_nc_s_

15-2. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
15-2. Th_s sh_k_s th_ c_nf_d_nc_ _f th_ s_ld__rs_

16-1. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes.
16-1. B_t wh_n th_ _rmy _s r_stl_ss _nd d_str_stf_l_ tr__bl_ _s s_r_ t_ c_m_ fr_m th_ _th_r f__d_l pr_nc_s_

16-2. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.
16-2. Th_s _s s_mply br_ng_ng _n_rchy _nt_ th_ _rmy_ _nd fl_ng_ng v_ct_ry _w_y_

17-1. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
17-1. Th_s w_ m_y kn_w th_t th_r_ _r_ f_v_ _ss_nt__ls f_r v_ct_ry_ _1_ H_ w_ll w_n wh_ kn_ws wh_n t_ f_ght _nd wh_n n_t t_ f_ght_

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
17-2. _2_ H_ w_ll w_n wh_ kn_ws h_w t_ h_ndl_ b_th s_p_r__r _nd _nf_r__r f_rc_s_

17-3. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
17-3. _3_ H_ w_ll w_n wh_s_ _rmy _s _n_m_t_d by th_ s_m_ sp_r_t thr__gh__t _ll _ts r_nks_

17-4. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.
17-4. _4_ H_ w_ll w_n wh__ pr_p_r_d h_ms_lf_ w__ts t_ t_k_ th_ _n_my _npr_p_r_d_

17-5. _5_ H_ w_ll w_n wh_ h_s m_l_t_ry c_p_c_ty _nd _s n_t _nt_rf_r_d w_th by th_ s_v_r__gn_

18-1. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
18-1. H_nc_ th_ s_y_ng_ _f y__ kn_w th_ _n_my _nd kn_w y__rs_lf_ y__ n__d n_t f__r th_ r_s_lt _f _ h_ndr_d b_ttl_s_

18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
18-2. _f y__ kn_w y__rs_lf b_t n_t th_ _n_my_ f_r _v_ry v_ct_ry g__n_d y__ w_ll _ls_ s_ff_r _ d_f__t_

18-3. _f y__ kn_w n__th_r th_ _n_my n_r y__rs_lf_ y__ w_ll s_cc_mb _n _v_ry b_ttl__
