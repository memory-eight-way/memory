IV. T_CT_C_L D_SP_S_T__NS

1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
1. S_n Tz_ s__d_ Th_ g__d f_ght_rs _f _ld f_rst p_t th_ms_lv_s b_y_nd th_ p_ss_b_l_ty _f d_f__t_ _nd th_n w__t_d f_r _n _pp_rt_n_ty _f d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my_

2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
2. T_ s_c_r_ __rs_lv_s _g__nst d_f__t l__s _n __r _wn h_nds_ b_t th_ _pp_rt_n_ty _f d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my _s pr_v_d_d by th_ _n_my h_ms_lf_

3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
3. Th_s th_ g__d f_ght_r _s _bl_ t_ s_c_r_ h_ms_lf _g__nst d_f__t_ b_t c_nn_t m_k_ c_rt__n _f d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my_

4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
4. H_nc_ th_ s_y_ng_ _n_ m_y kn_w h_w t_ c_nq__r w_th__t b__ng _bl_ t_ d_ _t_

5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
5. S_c_r_ty _g__nst d_f__t _mpl__s d_f_ns_v_ t_ct_cs_ _b_l_ty t_ d_f__t th_ _n_my m__ns t_k_ng th_ _ff_ns_v__

6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.
6. St_nd_ng _n th_ d_f_ns_v_ _nd_c_t_s _ns_ff_c__nt str_ngth_ _tt_ck_ng_ _ s_p_r_b_nd_nc_ _f str_ngth_

7-1. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.
7-1. Th_ g_n_r_l wh_ _s sk_ll_d _n d_f_ns_ h_d_s _n th_ m_st s_cr_t r_c_ss_s _f th_ __rth_ h_ wh_ _s sk_ll_d _n _tt_ck fl_sh_s f_rth fr_m th_ t_pm_st h__ghts _f h__v_n_

7-2. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.
7-2. Th_s _n th_ _n_ h_nd w_ h_v_ _b_l_ty t_ pr_t_ct __rs_lv_s_ _n th_ _th_r_ _ v_ct_ry th_t _s c_mpl_t__

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
8. T_ s__ v_ct_ry _nly wh_n _t _s w_th_n th_ k_n _f th_ c_mm_n h_rd _s n_t th_ _cm_ _f _xc_ll_nc__

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
9. N__th_r _s _t th_ _cm_ _f _xc_ll_nc_ _f y__ f_ght _nd c_nq__r _nd th_ wh_l_ _mp_r_ s_ys_ _W_ll d_n___

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
10. T_ l_ft _n __t_mn h__r _s n_ s_gn _f gr__t str_ngth_ t_ s__ th_ s_n _nd m__n _s n_ s_gn _f sh_rp s_ght_ t_ h__r th_ n__s_ _f th_nd_r _s n_ s_gn _f _ q__ck __r_

11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
11. Wh_t th_ _nc__nts c_ll_d _ cl_v_r f_ght_r _s _n_ wh_ n_t _nly w_ns_ b_t _xc_ls _n w_nn_ng w_th __s__

12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.
12. H_nc_ h_s v_ct_r__s br_ng h_m n__th_r r_p_t_t__n f_r w_sd_m n_r cr_d_t f_r c__r_g__

13-1. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
13-1. H_ w_ns h_s b_ttl_s by m_k_ng n_ m_st_k_s_

13-2. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
13-2. M_k_ng n_ m_st_k_s _s wh_t _st_bl_sh_s th_ c_rt__nty _f v_ct_ry_ f_r _t m__ns c_nq__r_ng _n _n_my th_t _s _lr__dy d_f__t_d_

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
14. H_nc_ th_ sk_llf_l f_ght_r p_ts h_ms_lf _nt_ _ p_s_t__n wh_ch m_k_s d_f__t _mp_ss_bl__ _nd d__s n_t m_ss th_ m_m_nt f_r d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my_

15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
15. Th_s _t _s th_t _n w_r th_ v_ct_r___s str_t_g_st _nly s__ks b_ttl_ _ft_r th_ v_ct_ry h_s b__n w_n_ wh_r__s h_ wh_ _s d_st_n_d t_ d_f__t f_rst f_ghts _nd _ft_rw_rds l__ks f_r v_ct_ry_

16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.
16. Th_ c_ns_mm_t_ l__d_r c_lt_v_t_s th_ m_r_l l_w_ _nd str_ctly _dh_r_s t_ m_th_d _nd d_sc_pl_n__ th_s _t _s _n h_s p_w_r t_ c_ntr_l s_cc_ss_

17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.

18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.

19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.

20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
