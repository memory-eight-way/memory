VIII. VARIATION IN TACTICS
VIII. _ARIATION _N _ACTICS

1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.
1. _un _zu _aid: _n _ar, _he _eneral _eceives _is _ommands _rom _he _overeign, _ollects _is _rmy _nd _oncentrates _is _orces.

2-1. When in difficult country, do not encamp.
2-1. _hen _n _ifficult _ountry, _o _ot _ncamp.

2-2. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.
2-2. _n _ountry _here _igh _oads _ntersect, _oin _ands _ith _our _llies.

2-3. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.
2-3. _o _ot _inger _n _angerously _solated _ositions.

2-4. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.
2-4. _n _emmed-in _ituations, _ou _ust _esort _o _tratagem.

2-5. In desperate position, you must fight.
2-5. _n _esperate _osition, _ou _ust _ight.

3. There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
3. _here _re _oads _hich _ust _ot _e _ollowed, _rmies _hich _ust _e _ot _ttacked, _owns _hich _ust _ot _e _esieged, _ositions _hich _ust _ot _e _ontested, _ommands _f _he _overeign _hich _ust _ot _e _beyed.

4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.
4. _he _eneral _ho _horoughly _nderstands _he _dvantages _hat _ccompany _ariation _f _actics _nows _ow _o _andle _is _roops.

5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.
5. _he _eneral _ho _oes _ot _nderstand _hese, _ay _e _ell _cquainted _ith _he _onfiguration _f _he _ountry, _et _e _ill _ot _e _ble _o _urn _is _nowledge _o _ractical _ccount.

6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.
6. _o, _he _tudent _f _ar _ho _s _nversed _n _he _rt _f _ar _f _arying _is _lans, _ven _hough _e _e _cquainted _ith _he _ive _dvantages, _ill _ail _o _ake _he _est _se _f _is _en.

7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.
7. _ence _n _he _ise _eader's _lans, _onsiderations _f _dvantage _nd _f _isadvantage _ill _e _lended _ogether.

8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
8. _f _ur _xpectation _f _dvantage _e _empered _n _his _ay, _e _ay _ucceed _n _ccomplishing _he _ssential _art _f _ur _chemes.

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.
9. _f, _n _he _ther _and, _n _he _idst _f _ifficulties _e _re _lways _eady _o _eize _n _dvantage, _e _ay _xtricate _urselves _rom _isfortune.

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.
10. _educe _he _ostile _hiefs _y _nflicting _amage _n _hem; _nd _ake _rouble _or _hem, _nd _eep _hem _onstantly _ngaged; _old _ut _pecious _llurements, _nd _ake _hem _ush _o _ny _iven _oint.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
11. _he _rt _f _ar _eaches _s _o _ely _ot _n _he _ikelihood _f _he _nemy's _ot _oming, _ut _n _ur _wn _eadiness _o _eceive _im; _ot _n _he _hance _f _is _ot _ttacking, _ut _ather _n _he _act _hat _e _ave _ade _ur _osition _nassailable.

12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
12. _here _re _ive _angerous _aults _hich _ay _ffect _ _eneral: _1) _ecklessness, _hich _eads _o _estruction; _2) _owardice, _hich _eads _o _apture; _3) _ _asty _emper, _hich _an _e _rovoked _y _nsults; _4) _ _elicacy _f _onor _hich _s _ensitive _o _hame; _5) _ver-solicitude _or _is _en, _hich _xposes _im _o _orry _nd _rouble.

13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.
13. _hese _re _he _ive _esetting _ins _f _ _eneral, _uinous _o _he _onduct _f _ar.

14-1. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults.
14-1. _hen _n _rmy _s _verthrown _nd _ts _eader _lain, _he _ause _ill _urely _e _ound _mong _hese _ive _angerous _aults.

14-2. Let them be a subject of meditation.
14-2. _et _hem _e _ _ubject _f _editation.
