I. LAYING PLANS
I. _AYING _LANS

1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
1. _un _zu _aid: _he _rt _f _ar _s _f _ital _mportance _o _he _tate.

2-1. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.
2-1. _t _s _ _atter _f _ife _nd _eath, _ _oad _ither _o _afety _r _o _uin.

2-2. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.
2-2. _ence _t _s _ _ubject _f _nquiry _hich _an _n _o _ccount _e _eglected.

3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.
3. _he _rt _f _ar, _hen, _s _overned _y _ive _onstant _actors, _o _e _aken _nto _ccount _n _ne's _eliberations, _hen _eeking _o _etermine _he _onditions _btaining _n _he _ield.

4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.
4. _hese _re: _1) _he _oral _aw; _2) _eaven; _3) _arth; _4) _he _ommander; _5) _ethod _nd _iscipline.

5,6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
5,6. _he _oral _aw _auses _he _eople _o _e _n _omplete _ccord _ith _heir _uler, _o _hat _hey _ill _ollow _im _egardless _f _heir _ives, _ndismayed _y _ny _anger.

7. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
7. _eaven _ignifies _ight _nd _ay, _old _nd _eat, _imes _nd _easons.

8. Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.
8. _arth _omprises _istances, _reat _nd _mall; _anger _nd _ecurity; _pen _round _nd _arrow _asses; _he _hances _f _ife _nd _eath.

9. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.
9. _he _ommander _tands _or _he _irtues _f _isdom, _incerity, _enevolence, _ourage _nd _trictness.

10. By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.
10. _y _ethod _nd _iscipline _re _o _e _nderstood _he _arshaling _f _he _rmy _n _ts _roper _ubdivisions, _he _raduations _f _ank _mong _he _fficers, _he _aintenance _f _oads _y _hich _upplies _ay _each _he _rmy, _nd _he _ontrol _f _ilitary _xpenditure.

11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.
11. _hese _ive _eads _hould _e _amiliar _o _very _eneral: _e _ho _nows _hem _ill _e _ictorious; _e _ho _nows _hem _ot _ill _ail.

12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--
12. _herefore, _n _our _eliberations, _hen _eeking _o _etermine _he _ilitary _onditions, _et _hem _e _ade _he _asis _f _ _omparison, _n _his _ise:--

13-1. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?
13-1. _1) _hich _f _he _wo _overeigns _s _mbued _ith _he _oral _aw?

13-2. (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?
13-2. _2) _hich _f _he _wo _enerals _as _ost _bility?

13-3. (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?
13-3. _3) _ith _hom _ie _he _dvantages _erived _rom _eaven _nd _arth?

13-4. (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
13-4. _4) _n _hich _ide _s _iscipline _ost _igorously _nforced?

13-5. (5) Which army is stronger?
13-5. _5) _hich _rmy _s _tronger?

13-6. (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
13-6. _6) _n _hich _ide _re _fficers _nd _en _ore _ighly _rained?

13-7. (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?
13-7. _7) _n _hich _rmy _s _here _he _reater _onstancy _oth _n _eward _nd _unishment?

14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.
14. _y _eans _f _hese _even _onsiderations _ _an _orecast _ictory _r _efeat.

15-1. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command!
15-1. _he _eneral _hat _earkens _o _y _ounsel _nd _cts _pon _t, _ill _onquer: _et _uch _ _ne _e _etained _n _ommand!

15-2. The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:-- let such a one be dismissed!
15-2. _he _eneral _hat _earkens _ot _o _y _ounsel _or _cts _pon _t, _ill _uffer _efeat:-- _et _uch _ _ne _e _ismissed!

16. While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.
16. _hile _eading _he _rofit _f _y _ounsel, _vail _ourself _lso _f _ny _elpful _ircumstances _ver _nd _eyond _he _rdinary _ules.

17. According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.
17. _ccording _s _ircumstances _re _avorable, _ne _hould _odify _ne's _lans.

18. All warfare is based on deception.
18. _ll _arfare _s _ased _n _eception.

19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
19. _ence, _hen _ble _o _ttack, _e _ust _eem _nable; _hen _sing _ur _orces, _e _ust _eem _nactive; _hen _e _re _ear, _e _ust _ake _he _nemy _elieve _e _re _ar _way; _hen _ar _way, _e _ust _ake _im _elieve _e _re _ear.

20-1. Hold out baits to entice the enemy.
20-1. _old _ut _aits _o _ntice _he _nemy.

20-2. Feign disorder, and crush him.
20-2. _eign _isorder, _nd _rush _im.

21-1. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.
21-1. _f _e _s _ecure _t _ll _oints, _e _repared _or _im.

21-2. If he is in superior strength, evade him.
21-2. _f _e _s _n _uperior _trength, _vade _im.

22-1. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.
22-1. _f _our _pponent _s _f _holeric _emper, _eek _o _rritate _im.

22-2. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
22-2. _retend _o _e _eak, _hat _e _ay _row _rrogant.

23-1. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
23-1. _f _e _s _aking _is _ase, _ive _im _o _est.

23-2. If his forces are united, separate them.
23-2. _f _is _orces _re _nited, _eparate _hem.

24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
24. _ttack _im _here _e _s _nprepared, _ppear _here _ou _re _ot _xpected.

25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.
25. _hese _ilitary _evices, _eading _o _ictory, _ust _ot _e _ivulged _eforehand.

26-1. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.
26-1. _ow _he _eneral _ho _ins _ _attle _akes _any _alculations _n _is _emple _re _he _attle _s _ought.

26-2. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.
26-2. _he _eneral _ho _oses _ _attle _akes _ut _ew _alculations _eforehand.

26-3. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all!
26-3. _hus _o _any _alculations _ead _o _ictory, _nd _ew _alculations _o _efeat: _ow _uch _ore _o _alculation _t _ll!

26-4. It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.
26-4. _t _s _y _ttention _o _his _oint _hat _ _an _oresee _ho _s _ikely _o _in _r _ose.
