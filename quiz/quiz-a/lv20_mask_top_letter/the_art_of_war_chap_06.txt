VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG
VI. _EAK _OINTS _ND _TRONG


1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
1. _un _zu _aid: _hoever _s _irst _n _he _ield _nd _waits _he _oming _f _he _nemy, _ill _e _resh _or _he _ight; _hoever _s _econd _n _he _ield _nd _as _o _asten _o _attle _ill _rrive _xhausted.

2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
2. _herefore _he _lever _ombatant _mposes _is _ill _n _he _nemy, _ut _oes _ot _llow _he _nemy's _ill _o _e _mposed _n _im.

3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.
3. _y _olding _ut _dvantages _o _im, _e _an _ause _he _nemy _o _pproach _f _is _wn _ccord; _r, _y _nflicting _amage, _e _an _ake _t _mpossible _or _he _nemy _o _raw _ear.

4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.
4. _f _he _nemy _s _aking _is _ase, _e _an _arass _im; _f _ell _upplied _ith _ood, _e _an _tarve _im _ut; _f _uietly _ncamped, _e _an _orce _im _o _ove.

5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.
5. _ppear _t _oints _hich _he _nemy _ust _asten _o _efend; _arch _wiftly _o _laces _here _ou _re _ot _xpected.

6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.
6. _n _rmy _ay _arch _reat _istances _ithout _istress, _f _t _arches _hrough _ountry _here _he _nemy _s _ot.

7-1. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.
7-1. _ou _an _e _ure _f _ucceeding _n _our _ttacks _f _ou _nly _ttack _laces _hich _re _ndefended.

7-2. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.
7-2. _ou _an _nsure _he _afety _f _our _efense _f _ou _nly _old _ositions _hat _annot _e _ttacked.

8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
8. _ence _hat _eneral _s _killful _n _ttack _hose _pponent _oes _ot _now _hat _o _efend; _nd _e _s _killful _n _efense _hose _pponent _oes _ot _now _hat _o _ttack.

9-1. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!
9-1. _ _ivine _rt _f _ubtlety _nd _ecrecy!

9-2. Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
9-2. _hrough _ou _e _earn _o _e _nvisible, _hrough _ou _naudible; _nd _ence _e _an _old _he _nemy's _ate _n _ur _ands.

10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
10. _ou _ay _dvance _nd _e _bsolutely _rresistible, _f _ou _ake _or _he _nemy's _eak _oints; _ou _ay _etire _nd _e _afe _rom _ursuit _f _our _ovements _re _ore _apid _han _hose _f _he _nemy.

11-1. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch.
11-1. _f _e _ish _o _ight, _he _nemy _an _e _orced _o _n _ngagement _ven _hough _e _e _heltered _ehind _ _igh _ampart _nd _ _eep _itch.

11-2. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
11-2. _ll _e _eed _o _s _ttack _ome _ther _lace _hat _e _ill _e _bliged _o _elieve.

12-1. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.
12-1. _f _e _o _ot _ish _o _ight, _e _an _revent _he _nemy _rom _ngaging _s _ven _hough _he _ines _f _ur _ncampment _e _erely _raced _ut _n _he _round.

12-2. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.
12-2. _ll _e _eed _o _s _o _hrow _omething _dd _nd _naccountable _n _is _ay.

13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.
13. _y _iscovering _he _nemy's _ispositions _nd _emaining _nvisible _urselves, _e _an _eep _ur _orces _oncentrated, _hile _he _nemy's _ust _e _ivided.

14-1. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions.
14-1. _e _an _orm _ _ingle _nited _ody, _hile _he _nemy _ust _plit _p _nto _ractions.

14-2. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
14-2. _ence _here _ill _e _ _hole _itted _gainst _eparate _arts _f _ _hole, _hich _eans _hat _e _hall _e _any _o _he _nemy's _ew.

15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
15. _nd _f _e _re _ble _hus _o _ttack _n _nferior _orce _ith _ _uperior _ne, _ur _pponents _ill _e _n _ire _traits.

16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.
16. _he _pot _here _e _ntend _o _ight _ust _ot _e _ade _nown; _or _hen _he _nemy _ill _ave _o _repare _gainst _ _ossible _ttack _t _everal _ifferent _oints; _nd _is _orces _eing _hus _istributed _n _any _irections, _he _umbers _e _hall _ave _o _ace _t _ny _iven _oint _ill _e _roportionately _ew.

17-1. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.
17-1. _or _hould _he _nemy _trengthen _is _an, _e _ill _eaken _is _ear; _hould _e _trengthen _is _ear, _e _ill _eaken _is _an; _hould _e _trengthen _is _eft, _e _ill _eaken _is _ight; _hould _e _trengthen _is _ight, _e _ill _eaken _is _eft.

17-2. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.
17-2. _f _e _ends _einforcements _verywhere, _e _ill _verywhere _e _eak.

18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.
18. _umerical _eakness _omes _rom _aving _o _repare _gainst _ossible _ttacks; _umerical _trength, _rom _ompelling _ur _dversary _o _ake _hese _reparations _gainst _s.

19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.
19. _nowing _he _lace _nd _he _ime _f _he _oming _attle, _e _ay _oncentrate _rom _he _reatest _istances _n _rder _o _ight.

20-1. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van.
20-1. _ut _f _either _ime _or _lace _e _nown, _hen _he _eft _ing _ill _e _mpotent _o _uccor _he _ight, _he _ight _qually _mpotent _o _uccor _he _eft, _he _an _nable _o _elieve _he _ear, _r _he _ear _o _upport _he _an.

20-2. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!
20-2. _ow _uch _ore _o _f _he _urthest _ortions _f _he _rmy _re _nything _nder _ _undred _I _part, _nd _ven _he _earest _re _eparated _y _everal _I!

21-1. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.
21-1. _hough _ccording _o _y _stimate _he _oldiers _f _ueh _xceed _ur _wn _n _umber, _hat _hall _dvantage _hem _othing _n _he _atter _f _ictory.

21-2. I say then that victory can be achieved.
21-2. _ _ay _hen _hat _ictory _an _e _chieved.

22-1. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting.
22-1. _hough _he _nemy _e _tronger _n _umbers, _e _ay _revent _im _rom _ighting.

22-2. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.
22-2. _cheme _o _s _o _iscover _is _lans _nd _he _ikelihood _f _heir _uccess.

23-1. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.
23-1. _ouse _im, _nd _earn _he _rinciple _f _is _ctivity _r _nactivity.

23-2. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.
23-2. _orce _im _o _eveal _imself, _o _s _o _ind _ut _is _ulnerable _pots.

24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.
24. _arefully _ompare _he _pposing _rmy _ith _our _wn, _o _hat _ou _ay _now _here _trength _s _uperabundant _nd _here _t _s _eficient.

25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.
25. _n _aking _actical _ispositions, _he _ighest _itch _ou _an _ttain _s _o _onceal _hem; _onceal _our _ispositions, _nd _ou _ill _e _afe _rom _he _rying _f _he _ubtlest _pies, _rom _he _achinations _f _he _isest _rains.

26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics-- that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
26. _ow _ictory _ay _e _roduced _or _hem _ut _f _he _nemy's _wn _actics-- _hat _s _hat _he _ultitude _annot _omprehend.

27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
27. _ll _en _an _ee _he _actics _hereby _ _onquer, _ut _hat _one _an _ee _s _he _trategy _ut _f _hich _ictory _s _volved.
28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
28. _o _ot _epeat _he _actics _hich _ave _ained _ou _ne _ictory, _ut _et _our _ethods _e _egulated _y _he _nfinite _ariety _f _ircumstances.

29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
29. _ilitary _actics _re _ike _nto _ater; _or _ater _n _ts _atural _ourse _uns _way _rom _igh _laces _nd _astens _ownwards.

30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.
30. _o _n _ar, _he _ay _s _o _void _hat _s _trong _nd _o _trike _t _hat _s _eak.

31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
31. _ater _hapes _ts _ourse _ccording _o _he _ature _f _he _round _ver _hich _t _lows; _he _oldier _orks _ut _is _ictory _n _elation _o _he _oe _hom _e _s _acing.

32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.
32. _herefore, _ust _s _ater _etains _o _onstant _hape, _o _n _arfare _here _re _o _onstant _onditions.

33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.
33. _e _ho _an _odify _is _actics _n _elation _o _is _pponent _nd _hereby _ucceed _n _inning, _ay _e _alled _ _eaven-born _aptain.

34-1. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn.
34-1. _he _ive _lements _water, _ire, _ood, _etal, _arth) _re _ot _lways _qually _redominant; _he _our _easons _ake _ay _or _ach _ther _n _urn.

34-2. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.
34-2. _here _re _hort _ays _nd _ong; _he _oon _as _ts _eriods _f _aning _nd _axing.
