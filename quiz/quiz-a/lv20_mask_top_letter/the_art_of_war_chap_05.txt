V. ENERGY
V. _NERGY

1. Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.
1. _un _zu _aid: _he _ontrol _f _ _arge _orce _s _he _ame _rinciple _s _he _ontrol _f _ _ew _en: _t _s _erely _ _uestion _f _ividing _p _heir _umbers.

2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.
2. _ighting _ith _ _arge _rmy _nder _our _ommand _s _owise _ifferent _rom _ighting _ith _ _mall _ne: _t _s _erely _ _uestion _f _nstituting _igns _nd _ignals.

3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.
3. _o _nsure _hat _our _hole _ost _ay _ithstand _he _runt _f _he _nemy's _ttack _nd _emain _nshaken-- _his _s _ffected _y _aneuvers _irect _nd _ndirect.

4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg-- this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.
4. _hat _he _mpact _f _our _rmy _ay _e _ike _ _rindstone _ashed _gainst _n _gg-- _his _s _ffected _y _he _cience _f _eak _oints _nd _trong.

5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.
5. _n _ll _ighting, _he _irect _ethod _ay _e _sed _or _oining _attle, _ut _ndirect _ethods _ill _e _eeded _n _rder _o _ecure _ictory.

6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.
6. _ndirect _actics, _fficiently _pplied, _re _nexhaustible _s _eaven _nd _arth, _nending _s _he _low _f _ivers _nd _treams; _ike _he _un _nd _oon, _hey _nd _ut _o _egin _new; _ike _he _our _easons, _hey _ass _way _o _eturn _nce _ore.

7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.
7. _here _re _ot _ore _han _ive _usical _otes, _et _he _ombinations _f _hese _ive _ive _ise _o _ore _elodies _han _an _ver _e _eard.

8. There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.
8. _here _re _ot _ore _han _ive _rimary _olors _blue, _ellow, _ed, _hite, _nd _lack), _et _n _ombination _hey _roduce _ore _ues _han _an _ver _een _een.

9. There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.
9. _here _re _ot _ore _han _ive _ardinal _astes _sour, _crid, _alt, _weet, _itter), _et _ombinations _f _hem _ield _ore _lavors _han _an _ver _e _asted.

10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack-- the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.
10. _n _attle, _here _re _ot _ore _han _wo _ethods _f _ttack-- _he _irect _nd _he _ndirect; _et _hese _wo _n _ombination _ive _ise _o _n _ndless _eries _f _aneuvers.

11-1. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn.
11-1. _he _irect _nd _he _ndirect _ead _n _o _ach _ther _n _urn.

11-2. It is like moving in a circle-- you never come to an end.
11-2. _t _s _ike _oving _n _ _ircle-- _ou _ever _ome _o _n _nd.

11-3. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?
11-3. _ho _an _xhaust _he _ossibilities _f _heir _ombination?

12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.
12. _he _nset _f _roops _s _ike _he _ush _f _ _orrent _hich _ill _ven _oll _tones _long _n _ts _ourse.

13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.
13. _he _uality _f _ecision _s _ike _he _ell-timed _woop _f _ _alcon _hich _nables _t _o _trike _nd _estroy _ts _ictim.

14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.
14. _herefore _he _ood _ighter _ill _e _errible _n _is _nset, _nd _rompt _n _is _ecision.

15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.
15. _nergy _ay _e _ikened _o _he _ending _f _ _rossbow; _ecision, _o _he _eleasing _f _ _rigger.

16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.
16. _mid _he _urmoil _nd _umult _f _attle, _here _ay _e _eeming _isorder _nd _et _o _eal _isorder _t _ll; _mid _onfusion _nd _haos, _our _rray _ay _e _ithout _ead _r _ail, _et _t _ill _e _roof _gainst _efeat.

17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.
17. _imulated _isorder _ostulates _erfect _iscipline, _imulated _ear _ostulates _ourage; _imulated _eakness _ostulates _trength.

18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.
18. _iding _rder _eneath _he _loak _f _isorder _s _imply _ _uestion _f _ubdivision; _oncealing _ourage _nder _ _how _f _imidity _resupposes _ _und _f _atent _nergy; _asking _trength _ith _eakness _s _o _e _ffected _y _actical _ispositions.

19-1. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.
19-1. _hus _ne _ho _s _killful _t _eeping _he _nemy _n _he _ove _aintains _eceitful _ppearances, _ccording _o _hich _he _nemy _ill _ct.

19-2. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.
19-2. _e _acrifices _omething, _hat _he _nemy _ay _natch _t _t.

20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.
20. _y _olding _ut _aits, _e _eeps _im _n _he _arch; _hen _ith _ _ody _f _icked _en _e _ies _n _ait _or _im.

21-1. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.
21-1. _he _lever _ombatant _ooks _o _he _ffect _f _ombined _nergy, _nd _oes _ot _equire _oo _uch _rom _ndividuals.

21-2. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.
21-2. _ence _is _bility _o _ick _ut _he _ight _en _nd _tilize _ombined _nergy.

22-1. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones.
22-1. _hen _e _tilizes _ombined _nergy, _is _ighting _en _ecome _s _t _ere _ike _nto _olling _ogs _r _tones.

22-2. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.
22-2. _or _t _s _he _ature _f _ _og _r _tone _o _emain _otionless _n _evel _round, _nd _o _ove _hen _n _ _lope; _f _our-cornered, _o _ome _o _ _tandstill, _ut _f _ound-shaped, _o _o _olling _own.

23-1. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height.
23-1. _hus _he _nergy _eveloped _y _ood _ighting _en _s _s _he _omentum _f _ _ound _tone _olled _own _ _ountain _housands _f _eet _n _eight.

23-2. So much on the subject of energy.
23-2. _o _uch _n _he _ubject _f _nergy.
