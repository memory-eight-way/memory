XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE
XII. _HE _TTACK _Y _IRE

1-1. Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire.
1-1. _un _zu _aid: _here _re _ive _ays _f _ttacking _ith _ire.

1-2. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.
1-2. _he _irst _s _o _urn _oldiers _n _heir _amp; _he _econd _s _o _urn _tores; _he _hird _s _o _urn _aggage _rains; _he _ourth _s _o _urn _rsenals _nd _agazines; _he _ifth _s _o _url _ropping _ire _mongst _he _nemy.

2-1. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.
2-1. _n _rder _o _arry _ut _n _ttack, _e _ust _ave _eans _vailable.

2-2. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.
2-2. _he _aterial _or _aising _ire _hould _lways _e _ept _n _eadiness.

3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.
3. _here _s _ _roper _eason _or _aking _ttacks _ith _ire, _nd _pecial _ays _or _tarting _ _onflagration.

4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.
4. _he _roper _eason _s _hen _he _eather _s _ery _ry; _he _pecial _ays _re _hose _hen _he _oon _s _n _he _onstellations _f _he _ieve, _he _all, _he _ing _r _he _ross-bar; _or _hese _our _re _ll _ays _f _ising _ind.

5-1. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments: 6.
5-1. _n _ttacking _ith _ire, _ne _hould _e _repared _o _eet _ive _ossible _evelopments: _.

5-2. (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.
5-2. _1) _hen _ire _reaks _ut _nside _o _nemy's _amp, _espond _t _nce _ith _n _ttack _rom _ithout.

7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.
7. _2) _f _here _s _n _utbreak _f _ire, _ut _he _nemy's _oldiers _emain _uiet, _ide _our _ime _nd _o _ot _ttack.

8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.
8. _3) _hen _he _orce _f _he _lames _as _eached _ts _eight, _ollow _t _p _ith _n _ttack, _f _hat _s _racticable; _f _ot, _tay _here _ou _re.

9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.
9. _4) _f _t _s _ossible _o _ake _n _ssault _ith _ire _rom _ithout, _o _ot _ait _or _t _o _reak _ut _ithin, _ut _eliver _our _ttack _t _ _avorable _oment.

10-1. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it.
10-1. _5) _hen _ou _tart _ _ire, _e _o _indward _f _t.

10-2. Do not attack from the leeward.
10-2. _o _ot _ttack _rom _he _eeward.

11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.
11. _ _ind _hat _ises _n _he _aytime _asts _ong, _ut _ _ight _reeze _oon _alls.

12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.
12. _n _very _rmy, _he _ive _evelopments _onnected _ith _ire _ust _e _nown, _he _ovements _f _he _tars _alculated, _nd _ _atch _ept _or _he _roper _ays.

13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.
13. _ence _hose _ho _se _ire _s _n _id _o _he _ttack _how _ntelligence; _hose _ho _se _ater _s _n _id _o _he _ttack _ain _n _ccession _f _trength.

14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.
14. _y _eans _f _ater, _n _nemy _ay _e _ntercepted, _ut _ot _obbed _f _ll _is _elongings.

15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.
15. _nhappy _s _he _ate _f _ne _ho _ries _o _in _is _attles _nd _ucceed _n _is _ttacks _ithout _ultivating _he _pirit _f _nterprise; _or _he _esult _s _aste _f _ime _nd _eneral _tagnation.

16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.
16. _ence _he _aying: _he _nlightened _uler _ays _is _lans _ell _head; _he _ood _eneral _ultivates _is _esources.

17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.
17. _ove _ot _nless _ou _ee _n _dvantage; _se _ot _our _roops _nless _here _s _omething _o _e _ained; _ight _ot _nless _he _osition _s _ritical.

18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.
18. _o _uler _hould _ut _roops _nto _he _ield _erely _o _ratify _is _wn _pleen; _o _eneral _hould _ight _ _attle _imply _ut _f _ique.

19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.
19. _f _t _s _o _our _dvantage, _ake _ _orward _ove; _f _ot, _tay _here _ou _re.

20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.
20. _nger _ay _n _ime _hange _o _ladness; _exation _ay _e _ucceeded _y _ontent.

21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.
21. _ut _ _ingdom _hat _as _nce _een _estroyed _an _ever _ome _gain _nto _eing; _or _an _he _ead _ver _e _rought _ack _o _ife.

22-1. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.
22-1. _ence _he _nlightened _uler _s _eedful, _nd _he _ood _eneral _ull _f _aution.

22-2. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.
22-2. _his _s _he _ay _o _eep _ _ountry _t _eace _nd _n _rmy _ntact.
