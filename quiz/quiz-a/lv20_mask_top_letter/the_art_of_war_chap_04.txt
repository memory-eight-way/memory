IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS
IV. _ACTICAL _ISPOSITIONS

1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
1. _un _zu _aid: _he _ood _ighters _f _ld _irst _ut _hemselves _eyond _he _ossibility _f _efeat, _nd _hen _aited _or _n _pportunity _f _efeating _he _nemy.

2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
2. _o _ecure _urselves _gainst _efeat _ies _n _ur _wn _ands, _ut _he _pportunity _f _efeating _he _nemy _s _rovided _y _he _nemy _imself.

3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
3. _hus _he _ood _ighter _s _ble _o _ecure _imself _gainst _efeat, _ut _annot _ake _ertain _f _efeating _he _nemy.

4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
4. _ence _he _aying: _ne _ay _now _ow _o _onquer _ithout _eing _ble _o _o _t.

5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
5. _ecurity _gainst _efeat _mplies _efensive _actics; _bility _o _efeat _he _nemy _eans _aking _he _ffensive.

6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.
6. _tanding _n _he _efensive _ndicates _nsufficient _trength; _ttacking, _ _uperabundance _f _trength.

7-1. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.
7-1. _he _eneral _ho _s _killed _n _efense _ides _n _he _ost _ecret _ecesses _f _he _arth; _e _ho _s _killed _n _ttack _lashes _orth _rom _he _opmost _eights _f _eaven.

7-2. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.
7-2. _hus _n _he _ne _and _e _ave _bility _o _rotect _urselves; _n _he _ther, _ _ictory _hat _s _omplete.

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
8. _o _ee _ictory _nly _hen _t _s _ithin _he _en _f _he _ommon _erd _s _ot _he _cme _f _xcellence.

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
9. _either _s _t _he _cme _f _xcellence _f _ou _ight _nd _onquer _nd _he _hole _mpire _ays, _Well _one!"

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
10. _o _ift _n _utumn _air _s _o _ign _f _reat _trength; _o _ee _he _un _nd _oon _s _o _ign _f _harp _ight; _o _ear _he _oise _f _hunder _s _o _ign _f _ _uick _ar.

11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
11. _hat _he _ncients _alled _ _lever _ighter _s _ne _ho _ot _nly _ins, _ut _xcels _n _inning _ith _ase.

12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.
12. _ence _is _ictories _ring _im _either _eputation _or _isdom _or _redit _or _ourage.

13-1. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
13-1. _e _ins _is _attles _y _aking _o _istakes.

13-2. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
13-2. _aking _o _istakes _s _hat _stablishes _he _ertainty _f _ictory, _or _t _eans _onquering _n _nemy _hat _s _lready _efeated.

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
14. _ence _he _killful _ighter _uts _imself _nto _ _osition _hich _akes _efeat _mpossible, _nd _oes _ot _iss _he _oment _or _efeating _he _nemy.

15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
15. _hus _t _s _hat _n _ar _he _ictorious _trategist _nly _eeks _attle _fter _he _ictory _as _een _on, _hereas _e _ho _s _estined _o _efeat _irst _ights _nd _fterwards _ooks _or _ictory.

16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.
16. _he _onsummate _eader _ultivates _he _oral _aw, _nd _trictly _dheres _o _ethod _nd _iscipline; _hus _t _s _n _is _ower _o _ontrol _uccess.

17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.
17. _n _espect _f _ilitary _ethod, _e _ave, _irstly, _easurement; _econdly, _stimation _f _uantity; _hirdly, _alculation; _ourthly, _alancing _f _hances; _ifthly, _ictory.

18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
18. _easurement _wes _ts _xistence _o _arth; _stimation _f _uantity _o _easurement; _alculation _o _stimation _f _uantity; _alancing _f _hances _o _alculation; _nd _ictory _o _alancing _f _hances.

19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.
19. _ _ictorious _rmy _pposed _o _ _outed _ne, _s _s _ _ound's _eight _laced _n _he _cale _gainst _ _ingle _rain.

20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
20. _he _nrush _f _ _onquering _orce _s _ike _he _ursting _f _ent-up _aters _nto _ _hasm _ _housand _athoms _eep.
