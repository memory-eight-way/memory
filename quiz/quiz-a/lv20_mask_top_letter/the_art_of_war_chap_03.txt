III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM
III. _TTACK _Y _TRATAGEM

1-1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
1-1. _un _zu _aid: _n _he _ractical _rt _f _ar, _he _est _hing _f _ll _s _o _ake _he _nemy's _ountry _hole _nd _ntact; _o _hatter _nd _estroy _t _s _ot _o _ood.

1-2. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
1-2. _o, _oo, _t _s _etter _o _ecapture _n _rmy _ntire _han _o _estroy _t, _o _apture _ _egiment, _ _etachment _r _ _ompany _ntire _han _o _estroy _hem.

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
2. _ence _o _ight _nd _onquer _n _ll _our _attles _s _ot _upreme _xcellence; _upreme _xcellence _onsists _n _reaking _he _nemy's _esistance _ithout _ighting.

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
3. _hus _he _ighest _orm _f _eneralship _s _o _alk _he _nemy's _lans; _he _ext _est _s _o _revent _he _unction _f _he _nemy's _orces; _he _ext _n _rder _s _o _ttack _he _nemy's _rmy _n _he _ield; _nd _he _orst _olicy _f _ll _s _o _esiege _alled _ities.

4-1. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.
4-1. _he _ule _s, _ot _o _esiege _alled _ities _f _t _an _ossibly _e _voided.

4-2. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.
4-2. _he _reparation _f _antlets, _ovable _helters, _nd _arious _mplements _f _ar, _ill _ake _p _hree _hole _onths; _nd _he _iling _p _f _ounds _ver _gainst _he _alls _ill _ake _hree _onths _ore.

5-1. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.
5-1. _he _eneral, _nable _o _ontrol _is _rritation, _ill _aunch _is _en _o _he _ssault _ike _warming _nts, _ith _he _esult _hat _ne-third _f _is _en _re _lain, _hile _he _own _till _emains _ntaken.

5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
5-2. _uch _re _he _isastrous _ffects _f _ _iege.

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
6. _herefore _he _killful _eader _ubdues _he _nemy's _roops _ithout _ny _ighting; _e _aptures _heir _ities _ithout _aying _iege _o _hem; _e _verthrows _heir _ingdom _ithout _engthy _perations _n _he _ield.

7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
7-1. _ith _is _orces _ntact _e _ill _ispute _he _astery _f _he _mpire, _nd _hus, _ithout _osing _ _an, _is _riumph _ill _e _omplete.

7-2. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
7-2. _his _s _he _ethod _f _ttacking _y _tratagem.

8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
8. _t _s _he _ule _n _ar, _f _ur _orces _re _en _o _he _nemy's _ne, _o _urround _im; _f _ive _o _ne, _o _ttack _im; _f _wice _s _umerous, _o _ivide _ur _rmy _nto _wo.

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
9. _f _qually _atched, _e _an _ffer _attle; _f _lightly _nferior _n _umbers, _e _an _void _he _nemy; _f _uite _nequal _n _very _ay, _e _an _lee _rom _im.

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.
10. _ence, _hough _n _bstinate _ight _ay _e _ade _y _ _mall _orce, _n _he _nd _t _ust _e _aptured _y _he _arger _orce.

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.
11. _ow _he _eneral _s _he _ulwark _f _he _tate; _f _he _ulwark _s _omplete _t _ll _oints; _he _tate _ill _e _trong; _f _he _ulwark _s _efective, _he _tate _ill _e _eak.

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--
12. _here _re _hree _ays _n _hich _ _uler _an _ring _isfortune _pon _is _rmy:--

13-1. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.
13-1. _1) _y _ommanding _he _rmy _o _dvance _r _o _etreat, _eing _gnorant _f _he _act _hat _t _annot _bey.

13-2. This is called hobbling the army.
13-2. _his _s _alled _obbling _he _rmy.

14-1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
14-1. _2) _y _ttempting _o _overn _n _rmy _n _he _ame _ay _s _e _dministers _ _ingdom, _eing _gnorant _f _he _onditions _hich _btain _n _n _rmy.

14-2. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.
14-2. _his _auses _estlessness _n _he _oldier's _inds.

15-1. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
15-1. _3) _y _mploying _he _fficers _f _is _rmy _ithout _iscrimination, _hrough _gnorance _f _he _ilitary _rinciple _f _daptation _o _ircumstances.

15-2. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
15-2. _his _hakes _he _onfidence _f _he _oldiers.

16-1. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes.
16-1. _ut _hen _he _rmy _s _estless _nd _istrustful, _rouble _s _ure _o _ome _rom _he _ther _eudal _rinces.

16-2. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.
16-2. _his _s _imply _ringing _narchy _nto _he _rmy, _nd _linging _ictory _way.

17-1. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
17-1. _hus _e _ay _now _hat _here _re _ive _ssentials _or _ictory: _1) _e _ill _in _ho _nows _hen _o _ight _nd _hen _ot _o _ight.

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
17-2. _2) _e _ill _in _ho _nows _ow _o _andle _oth _uperior _nd _nferior _orces.

17-3. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
17-3. _3) _e _ill _in _hose _rmy _s _nimated _y _he _ame _pirit _hroughout _ll _ts _anks.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.
17-4. _4) _e _ill _in _ho, _repared _imself, _aits _o _ake _he _nemy _nprepared.

17-5. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.
17-5. _5) _e _ill _in _ho _as _ilitary _apacity _nd _s _ot _nterfered _ith _y _he _overeign.

18-1. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
18-1. _ence _he _aying: _f _ou _now _he _nemy _nd _now _ourself, _ou _eed _ot _ear _he _esult _f _ _undred _attles.

18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
18-2. _f _ou _now _ourself _ut _ot _he _nemy, _or _very _ictory _ained _ou _ill _lso _uffer _ _efeat.

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
18-3. _f _ou _now _either _he _nemy _or _ourself, _ou _ill _uccumb _n _very _attle.
