XIII. THE USE OF SPIES
XIII. _HE _SE _F _PIES

1-1. Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State.
1-1. _un _zu _aid: _aising _ _ost _f _ _undred _housand _en _nd _arching _hem _reat _istances _ntails _eavy _oss _n _he _eople _nd _ _rain _n _he _esources _f _he _tate.

1-2. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver.
1-2. _he _aily _xpenditure _ill _mount _o _ _housand _unces _f _ilver.

1-3. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways.
1-3. _here _ill _e _ommotion _t _ome _nd _broad, _nd _en _ill _rop _own _xhausted _n _he _ighways.

1-4. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.
1-4. _s _any _s _even _undred _housand _amilies _ill _e _mpeded _n _heir _abor.

2-1. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day.
2-1. _ostile _rmies _ay _ace _ach _ther _or _ears, _triving _or _he _ictory _hich _s _ecided _n _ _ingle _ay.

2-2. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.
2-2. _his _eing _o, _o _emain _n _gnorance _f _he _nemy's _ondition _imply _ecause _ne _rudges _he _utlay _f _ _undred _unces _f _ilver _n _onors _nd _moluments, _s _he _eight _f _nhumanity.

3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.
3. _ne _ho _cts _hus _s _o _eader _f _en, _o _resent _elp _o _is _overeign, _o _aster _f _ictory.

4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.
4. _hus, _hat _nables _he _ise _overeign _nd _he _ood _eneral _o _trike _nd _onquer, _nd _chieve _hings _eyond _he _each _f _rdinary _en, _s _oreknowledge.

5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.
5. _ow _his _oreknowledge _annot _e _licited _rom _pirits; _t _annot _e _btained _nductively _rom _xperience, _or _y _ny _eductive _alculation.

6. Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.
6. _nowledge _f _he _nemy's _ispositions _an _nly _e _btained _rom _ther _en.

7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.
7. _ence _he _se _f _pies, _f _hom _here _re _ive _lasses: _1) _ocal _pies; _2) _nward _pies; _3) _onverted _pies; _4) _oomed _pies; _5) _urviving _pies.

8-1. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system.
8-1. _hen _hese _ive _inds _f _py _re _ll _t _ork, _one _an _iscover _he _ecret _ystem.

8-2. This is called "divine manipulation of the threads."
8-2. _his _s _alled _divine _anipulation _f _he _hreads."

8-3. It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.
8-3. _t _s _he _overeign's _ost _recious _aculty.

9. Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.
9. _aving _ocal _pies _eans _mploying _he _ervices _f _he _nhabitants _f _ _istrict.

10. Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.
10. _aving _nward _pies, _aking _se _f _fficials _f _he _nemy.

11. Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.
11. _aving _onverted _pies, _etting _old _f _he _nemy's _pies _nd _sing _hem _or _ur _wn _urposes.

12. Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.
12. _aving _oomed _pies, _oing _ertain _hings _penly _or _urposes _f _eception, _nd _llowing _ur _pies _o _now _f _hem _nd _eport _hem _o _he _nemy.

13. Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.
13. _urviving _pies, _inally, _re _hose _ho _ring _ack _ews _rom _he _nemy's _amp.

14-1. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies.
14-1. _ence _t _s _hat _hich _one _n _he _hole _rmy _re _ore _ntimate _elations _o _e _aintained _han _ith _pies.

14-2. None should be more liberally rewarded.
14-2. _one _hould _e _ore _iberally _ewarded.

14-3. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.
14-3. _n _o _ther _usiness _hould _reater _ecrecy _e _reserved.

15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.
15. _pies _annot _e _sefully _mployed _ithout _ _ertain _ntuitive _agacity.

16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.
16. _hey _annot _e _roperly _anaged _ithout _enevolence _nd _traightforwardness.

17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.
17. _ithout _ubtle _ngenuity _f _ind, _ne _annot _ake _ertain _f _he _ruth _f _heir _eports.

18. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.
18. _e _ubtle! _e _ubtle! _nd _se _our _pies _or _very _ind _f _usiness.

19. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.
19. _f _ _ecret _iece _f _ews _s _ivulged _y _ _py _efore _he _ime _s _ipe, _e _ust _e _ut _o _eath _ogether _ith _he _an _o _hom _he _ecret _as _old.

20-1. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command.
20-1. _hether _he _bject _e _o _rush _n _rmy, _o _torm _ _ity, _r _o _ssassinate _n _ndividual, _t _s _lways _ecessary _o _egin _y _inding _ut _he _ames _f _he _ttendants, _he _ides-de-camp, _nd _oor-keepers _nd _entries _f _he _eneral _n _ommand.

20-2. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.
20-2. _ur _pies _ust _e _ommissioned _o _scertain _hese.

21-1. The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed.
21-1. _he _nemy's _pies _ho _ave _ome _o _py _n _s _ust _e _ought _ut, _empted _ith _ribes, _ed _way _nd _omfortably _oused.

21-2. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.
21-2. _hus _hey _ill _ecome _onverted _pies _nd _vailable _or _ur _ervice.

22. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.
22. _t _s _hrough _he _nformation _rought _y _he _onverted _py _hat _e _re _ble _o _cquire _nd _mploy _ocal _nd _nward _pies.

23. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.
23. _t _s _wing _o _is _nformation, _gain, _hat _e _an _ause _he _oomed _py _o _arry _alse _idings _o _he _nemy.

24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.
24. _astly, _t _s _y _is _nformation _hat _he _urviving _py _an _e _sed _n _ppointed _ccasions.

25-1. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy.
25-1. _he _nd _nd _im _f _pying _n _ll _ts _ive _arieties _s _nowledge _f _he _nemy; _nd _his _nowledge _an _nly _e _erived, _n _he _irst _nstance, _rom _he _onverted _py.

25-2. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.
25-2. _ence _t _s _ssential _hat _he _onverted _py _e _reated _ith _he _tmost _iberality.

26-1. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia.
26-1. _f _ld, _he _ise _f _he _in _ynasty _as _ue _o _ _hih _ho _ad _erved _nder _he _sia.

26-2. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.
26-2. _ikewise, _he _ise _f _he _hou _ynasty _as _ue _o _u _a _ho _ad _erved _nder _he _in.

27-1. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results.
27-1. _ence _t _s _nly _he _nlightened _uler _nd _he _ise _eneral _ho _ill _se _he _ighest _ntelligence _f _he _rmy _or _urposes _f _pying _nd _hereby _hey _chieve _reat _esults.

27-2. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to move.
27-2. _pies _re _ _ost _mportant _lement _n _ater, _ecause _n _hem _epends _n _rmy's _bility _o _ove.
