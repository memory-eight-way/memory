II. WAGING WAR
II. _AGING _AR

1-1. Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day.
1-1. _un _zu _aid: _n _he _perations _f _ar, _here _here _re _n _he _ield _ _housand _wift _hariots, _s _any _eavy _hariots, _nd _ _undred _housand _ail-clad _oldiers, _ith _rovisions _nough _o _arry _hem _ _housand _i, _he _xpenditure _t _ome _nd _t _he _ront, _ncluding _ntertainment _f _uests, _mall _tems _uch _s _lue _nd _aint, _nd _ums _pent _n _hariots _nd _rmor, _ill _each _he _otal _f _ _housand _unces _f _ilver _er _ay.

1-2. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.
1-2. _uch _s _he _ost _f _aising _n _rmy _f _00,000 _en.

2-1. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped.
2-1. _hen _ou _ngage _n _ctual _ighting, _f _ictory _s _ong _n _oming, _hen _en's _eapons _ill _row _ull _nd _heir _rdor _ill _e _amped.

2-2. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.
2-2. _f _ou _ay _iege _o _ _own, _ou _ill _xhaust _our _trength.

3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.
3. _gain, _f _he _ampaign _s _rotracted, _he _esources _f _he _tate _ill _ot _e _qual _o _he _train.

4-1. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity.
4-1. _ow, _hen _our _eapons _re _ulled, _our _rdor _amped, _our _trength _xhausted _nd _our _reasure _pent, _ther _hieftains _ill _pring _p _o _ake _dvantage _f _our _xtremity.

4-2. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.
4-2. _hen _o _an, _owever _ise, _ill _e _ble _o _vert _he _onsequences _hat _ust _nsue.

5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.
5. _hus, _hough _e _ave _eard _f _tupid _aste _n _ar, _leverness _as _ever _een _een _ssociated _ith _ong _elays.

6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.
6. _here _s _o _nstance _f _ _ountry _aving _enefited _rom _rolonged _arfare.

7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.
7. _t _s _nly _ne _ho _s _horoughly _cquainted _ith _he _vils _f _ar _hat _an _horoughly _nderstand _he _rofitable _ay _f _arrying _t _n.

8. The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.
8. _he _killful _oldier _oes _ot _aise _ _econd _evy, _either _re _is _upply-wagons _oaded _ore _han _wice.

9-1. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy.
9-1. _ring _ar _aterial _ith _ou _rom _ome, _ut _orage _n _he _nemy.

9-2. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.
9-2. _hus _he _rmy _ill _ave _ood _nough _or _ts _eeds.

10-1. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance.
10-1. _overty _f _he _tate _xchequer _auses _n _rmy _o _e _aintained _y _ontributions _rom _ _istance.

10-2. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.
10-2. _ontributing _o _aintain _n _rmy _t _ _istance _auses _he _eople _o _e _mpoverished.

11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.
11. _n _he _ther _and, _he _roximity _f _n _rmy _auses _rices _o _o _p; _nd _igh _rices _ause _he _eople's _ubstance _o _e _rained _way.

12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.
12. _hen _heir _ubstance _s _rained _way, _he _easantry _ill _e _fflicted _y _eavy _xactions.

13,14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.
13,14. _ith _his _oss _f _ubstance _nd _xhaustion _f _trength, _he _omes _f _he _eople _ill _e _tripped _are, _nd _hree-tenths _f _heir _ncome _ill _e _issipated; _hile _overnment _xpenses _or _roken _hariots, _orn-out _orses, _reast-plates _nd _elmets, _ows _nd _rrows, _pears _nd _hields, _rotective _antles, _raught-oxen _nd _eavy _agons, _ill _mount _o _our-tenths _f _ts _otal _evenue.

15-1. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy.
15-1. _ence _ _ise _eneral _akes _ _oint _f _oraging _n _he _nemy.

15-2. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.
15-2. _ne _artload _f _he _nemy's _rovisions _s _quivalent _o _wenty _f _ne's _wn, _nd _ikewise _ _ingle _icul _f _is _rovender _s _quivalent _o _wenty _rom _ne's _wn _tore.

16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.
16. _ow _n _rder _o _ill _he _nemy, _ur _en _ust _e _oused _o _nger; _hat _here _ay _e _dvantage _rom _efeating _he _nemy, _hey _ust _ave _heir _ewards.

17-1. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first.
17-1. _herefore _n _hariot _ighting, _hen _en _r _ore _hariots _ave _een _aken, _hose _hould _e _ewarded _ho _ook _he _irst.

17-2. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours.
17-2. _ur _wn _lags _hould _e _ubstituted _or _hose _f _he _nemy, _nd _he _hariots _ingled _nd _sed _n _onjunction _ith _urs.

17-3. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.
17-3. _he _aptured _oldiers _hould _e _indly _reated _nd _ept.

18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.
18. _his _s _alled, _sing _he _onquered _oe _o _ugment _ne's _wn _trength.

19. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.
19. _n _ar, _hen, _et _our _reat _bject _e _ictory, _ot _engthy _ampaigns.

20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.
20. _hus _t _ay _e _nown _hat _he _eader _f _rmies _s _he _rbiter _f _he _eople's _ate, _he _an _n _hom _t _epends _hether _he _ation _hall _e _n _eace _r _n _eril.
