XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS
XI. _HE _INE _ITUATIONS

1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.
1. _un _zu _aid: _he _rt _f _ar _ecognizes _ine _arieties _f _round: _1) _ispersive _round; _2) _acile _round; _3) _ontentious _round; _4) _pen _round; _5) _round _f _ntersecting _ighways; _6) _erious _round; _7) _ifficult _round; _8) _emmed-in _round; _9) _esperate _round.

2. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.
2. _hen _ _hieftain _s _ighting _n _is _wn _erritory, _t _s _ispersive _round.

3. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.
3. _hen _e _as _enetrated _nto _ostile _erritory, _ut _o _o _reat _istance, _t _s _acile _round.

4. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.
4. _round _he _ossession _f _hich _mports _reat _dvantage _o _ither _ide, _s _ontentious _round.

5. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.
5. _round _n _hich _ach _ide _as _iberty _f _ovement _s _pen _round.

6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.
6. _round _hich _orms _he _ey _o _hree _ontiguous _tates, _o _hat _e _ho _ccupies _t _irst _as _ost _f _he _mpire _t _is _ommand, _s _ _round _f _ntersecting _ighways.

7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.
7. _hen _n _rmy _as _enetrated _nto _he _eart _f _ _ostile _ountry, _eaving _ _umber _f _ortified _ities _n _ts _ear, _t _s _erious _round.

8. Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens-- all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.
8. _ountain _orests, _ugged _teeps, _arshes _nd _ens-- _ll _ountry _hat _s _ard _o _raverse: _his _s _ifficult _round.

9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.
9. _round _hich _s _eached _hrough _arrow _orges, _nd _rom _hich _e _an _nly _etire _y _ortuous _aths, _o _hat _ _mall _umber _f _he _nemy _ould _uffice _o _rush _ _arge _ody _f _ur _en: _his _s _emmed _n _round.

10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.
10. _round _n _hich _e _an _nly _e _aved _rom _estruction _y _ighting _ithout _elay, _s _esperate _round.

11-1. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not.
11-1. _n _ispersive _round, _herefore, _ight _ot.

11-2. On facile ground, halt not.
11-2. _n _acile _round, _alt _ot.

11-3. On contentious ground, attack not.
11-3. _n _ontentious _round, _ttack _ot.

12-1. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way.
12-1. _n _pen _round, _o _ot _ry _o _lock _he _nemy's _ay.

12-2. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.
12-2. _n _he _round _f _ntersecting _ighways, _oin _ands _ith _our _llies.

13-1. On serious ground, gather in plunder.
13-1. _n _erious _round, _ather _n _lunder.

13-2. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.
13-2. _n _ifficult _round, _eep _teadily _n _he _arch.

14-1. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.
14-1. _n _emmed-in _round, _esort _o _tratagem.

14-2. On desperate ground, fight.
14-2. _n _esperate _round, _ight.

15. Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.
15. _hose _ho _ere _alled _killful _eaders _f _ld _new _ow _o _rive _ _edge _etween _he _nemy's _ront _nd _ear; _o _revent _o-operation _etween _is _arge _nd _mall _ivisions; _o _inder _he _ood _roops _rom _escuing _he _ad, _he _fficers _rom _allying _heir _en.

16. When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.
16. _hen _he _nemy's _en _ere _nited, _hey _anaged _o _eep _hem _n _isorder.

17. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.
17. _hen _t _as _o _heir _dvantage, _hey _ade _ _orward _ove; _hen _therwise, _hey _topped _till.

18. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: "Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will."
18. _f _sked _ow _o _ope _ith _ _reat _ost _f _he _nemy _n _rderly _rray _nd _n _he _oint _f _arching _o _he _ttack, _ _hould _ay: _Begin _y _eizing _omething _hich _our _pponent _olds _ear; _hen _e _ill _e _menable _o _our _ill."

19. Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.
19. _apidity _s _he _ssence _f _ar: _ake _dvantage _f _he _nemy's _nreadiness, _ake _our _ay _y _nexpected _outes, _nd _ttack _nguarded _pots.

20. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.
20. _he _ollowing _re _he _rinciples _o _e _bserved _y _n _nvading _orce: _he _urther _ou _enetrate _nto _ _ountry, _he _reater _ill _e _he _olidarity _f _our _roops, _nd _hus _he _efenders _ill _ot _revail _gainst _ou.

21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.
21. _ake _orays _n _ertile _ountry _n _rder _o _upply _our _rmy _ith _ood.

22-1. Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them.
22-1. _arefully _tudy _he _ell-being _f _our _en, _nd _o _ot _vertax _hem.

22-2. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.
22-2. _oncentrate _our _nergy _nd _oard _our _trength.

22-3. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.
22-3. _eep _our _rmy _ontinually _n _he _ove, _nd _evise _nfathomable _lans.

23-1. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight.
23-1. _hrow _our _oldiers _nto _ositions _hence _here _s _o _scape, _nd _hey _ill _refer _eath _o _light.

23-2. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve.
23-2. _f _hey _ill _ace _eath, _here _s _othing _hey _ay _ot _chieve.

23-3. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.
23-3. _fficers _nd _en _like _ill _ut _orth _heir _ttermost _trength.

24-1. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear.
24-1. _oldiers _hen _n _esperate _traits _ose _he _ense _f _ear.

24-2. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm.
24-2. _f _here _s _o _lace _f _efuge, _hey _ill _tand _irm.

24-3. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front.
24-3. _f _hey _re _n _ostile _ountry, _hey _ill _how _ _tubborn _ront.

24-4. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.
24-4. _f _here _s _o _elp _or _t, _hey _ill _ight _ard.

25. Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.
25. _hus, _ithout _aiting _o _e _arshaled, _he _oldiers _ill _e _onstantly _n _he _ui _ive; _ithout _aiting _o _e _sked, _hey _ill _o _our _ill; _ithout _estrictions, _hey _ill _e _aithful; _ithout _iving _rders, _hey _an _e _rusted.

26-1. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts.
26-1. _rohibit _he _aking _f _mens, _nd _o _way _ith _uperstitious _oubts.

26-2. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.
26-2. _hen, _ntil _eath _tself _omes, _o _alamity _eed _e _eared.

27. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.
27. _f _ur _oldiers _re _ot _verburdened _ith _oney, _t _s _ot _ecause _hey _ave _ _istaste _or _iches; _f _heir _ives _re _ot _nduly _ong, _t _s _ot _ecause _hey _re _isinclined _o _ongevity.

28-1. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks.
28-1. _n _he _ay _hey _re _rdered _ut _o _attle, _our _oldiers _ay _eep, _hose _itting _p _edewing _heir _arments, _nd _hose _ying _own _etting _he _ears _un _own _heir _heeks.

28-2. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.
28-2. _ut _et _hem _nce _e _rought _o _ay, _nd _hey _ill _isplay _he _ourage _f _ _hu _r _ _uei.

29-1. The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan.
29-1. _he _killful _actician _ay _e _ikened _o _he _huai-jan.

29-2. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the ChUng mountains.
29-2. _ow _he _huai-jan _s _ _nake _hat _s _ound _n _he _hUng _ountains.

29-3. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.
29-3. _trike _t _ts _ead, _nd _ou _ill _e _ttacked _y _ts _ail; _trike _t _ts _ail, _nd _ou _ill _e _ttacked _y _ts _ead; _trike _t _ts _iddle, _nd _ou _ill _e _ttacked _y _ead _nd _ail _oth.

30-1. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes.
30-1. _sked _f _n _rmy _an _e _ade _o _mitate _he _huai-jan, _ _hould _nswer, _es.

30-2. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.
30-2. _or _he _en _f _u _nd _he _en _f _ueh _re _nemies; _et _f _hey _re _rossing _ _iver _n _he _ame _oat _nd _re _aught _y _ _torm, _hey _ill _ome _o _ach _ther's _ssistance _ust _s _he _eft _and _elps _he _ight.

31. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.
31. _ence _t _s _ot _nough _o _ut _ne's _rust _n _he _ethering _f _orses, _nd _he _urying _f _hariot _heels _n _he _round.

32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.
32. _he _rinciple _n _hich _o _anage _n _rmy _s _o _et _p _ne _tandard _f _ourage _hich _ll _ust _each.

33. How to make the best of both strong and weak-- that is a question involving the proper use of ground.
33. _ow _o _ake _he _est _f _oth _trong _nd _eak-- _hat _s _ _uestion _nvolving _he _roper _se _f _round.

34. Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.
34. _hus _he _killful _eneral _onducts _is _rmy _ust _s _hough _e _ere _eading _ _ingle _an, _illy-nilly, _y _he _and.

35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.
35. _t _s _he _usiness _f _ _eneral _o _e _uiet _nd _hus _nsure _ecrecy; _pright _nd _ust, _nd _hus _aintain _rder.

36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.
36. _e _ust _e _ble _o _ystify _is _fficers _nd _en _y _alse _eports _nd _ppearances, _nd _hus _eep _hem _n _otal _gnorance.

37-1. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.
37-1. _y _ltering _is _rrangements _nd _hanging _is _lans, _e _eeps _he _nemy _ithout _efinite _nowledge.

37-2. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.
37-2. _y _hifting _is _amp _nd _aking _ircuitous _outes, _e _revents _he _nemy _rom _nticipating _is _urpose.

38-1. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.
38-1. _t _he _ritical _oment, _he _eader _f _n _rmy _cts _ike _ne _ho _as _limbed _p _ _eight _nd _hen _icks _way _he _adder _ehind _im.

38-2. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.
38-2. _e _arries _is _en _eep _nto _ostile _erritory _efore _e _hows _is _and.

39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.
39. _e _urns _is _oats _nd _reaks _is _ooking-pots; _ike _ _hepherd _riving _ _lock _f _heep, _e _rives _is _en _his _ay _nd _hat, _nd _othing _nows _hither _e _s _oing.

40. To muster his host and bring it into danger:-- this may be termed the business of the general.
40. _o _uster _is _ost _nd _ring _t _nto _anger:-- _his _ay _e _ermed _he _usiness _f _he _eneral.

41. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.
41. _he _ifferent _easures _uited _o _he _ine _arieties _f _round; _he _xpediency _f _ggressive _r _efensive _actics; _nd _he _undamental _aws _f _uman _ature: _hese _re _hings _hat _ust _ost _ertainly _e _tudied.

42. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.
42. _hen _nvading _ostile _erritory, _he _eneral _rinciple _s, _hat _enetrating _eeply _rings _ohesion; _enetrating _ut _ _hort _ay _eans _ispersion.

43-1. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.
43-1. _hen _ou _eave _our _wn _ountry _ehind, _nd _ake _our _rmy _cross _eighborhood _erritory, _ou _ind _ourself _n _ritical _round.

43-2. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.
43-2. _hen _here _re _eans _f _ommunication _n _ll _our _ides, _he _round _s _ne _f _ntersecting _ighways.

44-1. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.
44-1. _hen _ou _enetrate _eeply _nto _ _ountry, _t _s _erious _round.

44-2. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.
44-2. _hen _ou _enetrate _ut _ _ittle _ay, _t _s _acile _round.

45-1. When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground.
45-1. _hen _ou _ave _he _nemy's _trongholds _n _our _ear, _nd _arrow _asses _n _ront, _t _s _emmed-in _round.

45-2. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.
45-2. _hen _here _s _o _lace _f _efuge _t _ll, _t _s _esperate _round.

46-1. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose.
46-1. _herefore, _n _ispersive _round, _ _ould _nspire _y _en _ith _nity _f _urpose.

46-2. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.
46-2. _n _acile _round, _ _ould _ee _hat _here _s _lose _onnection _etween _ll _arts _f _y _rmy.

47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.
47. _n _ontentious _round, _ _ould _urry _p _y _ear.

48-1. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses.
48-1. _n _pen _round, _ _ould _eep _ _igilant _ye _n _y _efenses.

48-2. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.
48-2. _n _round _f _ntersecting _ighways, _ _ould _onsolidate _y _lliances.

49-1. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies.
49-1. _n _erious _round, _ _ould _ry _o _nsure _ _ontinuous _tream _f _upplies.

49-2. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.
49-2. _n _ifficult _round, _ _ould _eep _ushing _n _long _he _oad.

50-1. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.
50-1. _n _emmed-in _round, _ _ould _lock _ny _ay _f _etreat.

50-2. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.
50-2. _n _esperate _round, _ _ould _roclaim _o _y _oldiers _he _opelessness _f _aving _heir _ives.

51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.
51. _or _t _s _he _oldier's _isposition _o _ffer _n _bstinate _esistance _hen _urrounded, _o _ight _ard _hen _e _annot _elp _imself, _nd _o _bey _romptly _hen _e _as _allen _nto _anger.

52-1. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs.
52-1. _e _annot _nter _nto _lliance _ith _eighboring _rinces _ntil _e _re _cquainted _ith _heir _esigns.

52-2. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country-- its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.
52-2. _e _re _ot _it _o _ead _n _rmy _n _he _arch _nless _e _re _amiliar _ith _he _ace _f _he _ountry-- _ts _ountains _nd _orests, _ts _itfalls _nd _recipices, _ts _arshes _nd _wamps.

52-3. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.
52-3. _e _hall _e _nable _o _urn _atural _dvantages _o _ccount _nless _e _ake _se _f _ocal _uides.

53. To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.
53. _o _e _gnored _f _ny _ne _f _he _ollowing _our _r _ive _rinciples _oes _ot _efit _ _arlike _rince.

54-1. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces.
54-1. _hen _ _arlike _rince _ttacks _ _owerful _tate, _is _eneralship _hows _tself _n _reventing _he _oncentration _f _he _nemy's _orces.

54-2. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.
54-2. _e _verawes _is _pponents, _nd _heir _llies _re _revented _rom _oining _gainst _im.

55-1. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states.
55-1. _ence _e _oes _ot _trive _o _lly _imself _ith _ll _nd _undry, _or _oes _e _oster _he _ower _f _ther _tates.

55-2. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe.
55-2. _e _arries _ut _is _wn _ecret _esigns, _eeping _is _ntagonists _n _we.

55-3. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.
55-3. _hus _e _s _ble _o _apture _heir _ities _nd _verthrow _heir _ingdoms.

56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.
56. _estow _ewards _ithout _egard _o _ule, _ssue _rders _ithout _egard _o _revious _rrangements; _nd _ou _ill _e _ble _o _andle _ _hole _rmy _s _hough _ou _ad _o _o _ith _ut _ _ingle _an.

57-1. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design.
57-1. _onfront _our _oldiers _ith _he _eed _tself; _ever _et _hem _now _our _esign.

57-2. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.
57-2. _hen _he _utlook _s _right, _ring _t _efore _heir _yes; _ut _ell _hem _othing _hen _he _ituation _s _loomy.

58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.
58. _lace _our _rmy _n _eadly _eril, _nd _t _ill _urvive; _lunge _t _nto _esperate _traits, _nd _t _ill _ome _ff _n _afety.

59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.
59. _or _t _s _recisely _hen _ _orce _as _allen _nto _arm's _ay _hat _s _apable _f _triking _ _low _or _ictory.

60. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.
60. _uccess _n _arfare _s _ained _y _arefully _ccommodating _urselves _o _he _nemy's _urpose.

61. By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.
61. _y _ersistently _anging _n _he _nemy's _lank, _e _hall _ucceed _n _he _ong _un _n _illing _he _ommander-in-chief.

62. This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.
62. _his _s _alled _bility _o _ccomplish _ _hing _y _heer _unning.

63. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.
63. _n _he _ay _hat _ou _ake _p _our _ommand, _lock _he _rontier _asses, _estroy _he _fficial _allies, _nd _top _he _assage _f _ll _missaries.

64. Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.
64. _e _tern _n _he _ouncil-chamber, _o _hat _ou _ay _ontrol _he _ituation.

65. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.
65. _f _he _nemy _eaves _ _oor _pen, _ou _ust _ush _n.

66. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.
66. _orestall _our _pponent _y _eizing _hat _e _olds _ear, _nd _ubtly _ontrive _o _ime _is _rrival _n _he _round.

67. Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.
67. _alk _n _he _ath _efined _y _ule, _nd _ccommodate _ourself _o _he _nemy _ntil _ou _an _ight _ _ecisive _attle.

68. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.
68. _t _irst, _hen, _xhibit _he _oyness _f _ _aiden, _ntil _he _nemy _ives _ou _n _pening; _fterwards _mulate _he _apidity _f _ _unning _are, _nd _t _ill _e _oo _ate _or _he _nemy _o _ppose _ou.
