VII. MANEUVERING
VII. _ANEUVERING

1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.
1. _un _zu _aid: _n _ar, _he _eneral _eceives _is _ommands _rom _he _overeign.

2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.
2. _aving _ollected _n _rmy _nd _oncentrated _is _orces, _e _ust _lend _nd _armonize _he _ifferent _lements _hereof _efore _itching _is _amp.

3-1. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult.
3-1. _fter _hat, _omes _actical _aneuvering, _han _hich _here _s _othing _ore _ifficult.

3-2. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.
3-2. _he _ifficulty _f _actical _aneuvering _onsists _n _urning _he _evious _nto _he _irect, _nd _isfortune _nto _ain.

4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.
4. _hus, _o _ake _ _ong _nd _ircuitous _oute, _fter _nticing _he _nemy _ut _f _he _ay, _nd _hough _tarting _fter _im, _o _ontrive _o _each _he _oal _efore _im, _hows _nowledge _f _he _rtifice _f _EVIATION.

5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.
5. _aneuvering _ith _n _rmy _s _dvantageous; _ith _n _ndisciplined _ultitude, _ost _angerous.

6-1. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.
6-1. _f _ou _et _ _ully _quipped _rmy _n _arch _n _rder _o _natch _n _dvantage, _he _hances _re _hat _ou _ill _e _oo _ate.

6-2. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.
6-2. _n _he _ther _and, _o _etach _ _lying _olumn _or _he _urpose _nvolves _he _acrifice _f _ts _aggage _nd _tores.

7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.
7. _hus, _f _ou _rder _our _en _o _oll _p _heir _uff-coats, _nd _ake _orced _arches _ithout _alting _ay _r _ight, _overing _ouble _he _sual _istance _t _ _tretch, _oing _ _undred _I _n _rder _o _rest _n _dvantage, _he _eaders _f _ll _our _hree _ivisions _ill _all _nto _he _ands _f _he _nemy.

8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.
8. _he _tronger _en _ill _e _n _ront, _he _aded _nes _ill _all _ehind, _nd _n _his _lan _nly _ne-tenth _f _our _rmy _ill _each _ts _estination.

9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.
9. _f _ou _arch _ifty _I _n _rder _o _utmaneuver _he _nemy, _ou _ill _ose _he _eader _f _our _irst _ivision, _nd _nly _alf _our _orce _ill _each _he _oal.

10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.
10. _f _ou _arch _hirty _I _ith _he _ame _bject, _wo-thirds _f _our _rmy _ill _rrive.

11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.
11. _e _ay _ake _t _hen _hat _n _rmy _ithout _ts _aggage-train _s _ost; _ithout _rovisions _t _s _ost; _ithout _ases _f _upply _t _s _ost.

12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.
12. _e _annot _nter _nto _lliances _ntil _e _re _cquainted _ith _he _esigns _f _ur _eighbors.

13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country-- its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.
13. _e _re _ot _it _o _ead _n _rmy _n _he _arch _nless _e _re _amiliar _ith _he _ace _f _he _ountry-- _ts _ountains _nd _orests, _ts _itfalls _nd _recipices, _ts _arshes _nd _wamps.

14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.
14. _e _hall _e _nable _o _urn _atural _dvantage _o _ccount _nless _e _ake _se _f _ocal _uides.

15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.
15. _n _ar, _ractice _issimulation, _nd _ou _ill _ucceed.

16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.
16. _hether _o _oncentrate _r _o _ivide _our _roops, _ust _e _ecided _y _ircumstances.

17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.
17. _et _our _apidity _e _hat _f _he _ind, _our _ompactness _hat _f _he _orest.

18. In raiding and plundering be like fire, in immovability like a mountain.
18. _n _aiding _nd _lundering _e _ike _ire, _n _mmovability _ike _ _ountain.

19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
19. _et _our _lans _e _ark _nd _mpenetrable _s _ight, _nd _hen _ou _ove, _all _ike _ _hunderbolt.

20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.
20. _hen _ou _lunder _ _ountryside, _et _he _poil _e _ivided _mongst _our _en; _hen _ou _apture _ew _erritory, _ut _t _p _nto _llotments _or _he _enefit _f _he _oldiery.

21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.
21. _onder _nd _eliberate _efore _ou _ake _ _ove.

22-1. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.
22-1. _e _ill _onquer _ho _as _earnt _he _rtifice _f _eviation.

22-2. Such is the art of maneuvering.
22-2. _uch _s _he _rt _f _aneuvering.

23-1. The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums.
23-1. _he _ook _f _rmy _anagement _ays: _n _he _ield _f _attle, _he _poken _ord _oes _ot _arry _ar _nough: _ence _he _nstitution _f _ongs _nd _rums.

23-2. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.
23-2. _or _an _rdinary _bjects _e _een _learly _nough: _ence _he _nstitution _f _anners _nd _lags.

24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.
24. _ongs _nd _rums, _anners _nd _lags, _re _eans _hereby _he _ars _nd _yes _f _he _ost _ay _e _ocused _n _ne _articular _oint.

25-1. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.
25-1. _he _ost _hus _orming _ _ingle _nited _ody, _s _t _mpossible _ither _or _he _rave _o _dvance _lone, _r _or _he _owardly _o _etreat _lone.

25-2. This is the art of handling large masses of men.
25-2. _his _s _he _rt _f _andling _arge _asses _f _en.

26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.
26. _n _ight-fighting, _hen, _ake _uch _se _f _ignal-fires _nd _rums, _nd _n _ighting _y _ay, _f _lags _nd _anners, _s _ _eans _f _nfluencing _he _ars _nd _yes _f _our _rmy.

27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.
27. _ _hole _rmy _ay _e _obbed _f _ts _pirit; _ _ommander-in-chief _ay _e _obbed _f _is _resence _f _ind.

28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.
28. _ow _ _oldier's _pirit _s _eenest _n _he _orning; _y _oonday _t _as _egun _o _lag; _nd _n _he _vening, _is _ind _s _ent _nly _n _eturning _o _amp.

29-1. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.
29-1. _ _lever _eneral, _herefore, _voids _n _rmy _hen _ts _pirit _s _een, _ut _ttacks _t _hen _t _s _luggish _nd _nclined _o _eturn.

29-2. This is the art of studying moods.
29-2. _his _s _he _rt _f _tudying _oods.

30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:-- this is the art of retaining self-possession.
30. _isciplined _nd _alm, _o _wait _he _ppearance _f _isorder _nd _ubbub _mongst _he _nemy:-- _his _s _he _rt _f _etaining _elf-possession.

31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:-- this is the art of husbanding one's strength.
31. _o _e _ear _he _oal _hile _he _nemy _s _till _ar _rom _t, _o _ait _t _ase _hile _he _nemy _s _oiling _nd _truggling, _o _e _ell-fed _hile _he _nemy _s _amished:-- _his _s _he _rt _f _usbanding _ne's _trength.

32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:-- this is the art of studying circumstances.
32. _o _efrain _rom _ntercepting _n _nemy _hose _anners _re _n _erfect _rder, _o _efrain _rom _ttacking _n _rmy _rawn _p _n _alm _nd _onfident _rray:-- _his _s _he _rt _f _tudying _ircumstances.

33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.
33. _t _s _ _ilitary _xiom _ot _o _dvance _phill _gainst _he _nemy, _or _o _ppose _im _hen _e _omes _ownhill.

34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.
34. _o _ot _ursue _n _nemy _ho _imulates _light; _o _ot _ttack _oldiers _hose _emper _s _een.

35-1. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.
35-1. _o _ot _wallow _ait _ffered _y _he _nemy.

35-2. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.
35-2. _o _ot _nterfere _ith _n _rmy _hat _s _eturning _ome.

36-1. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.
36-1. _hen _ou _urround _n _rmy, _eave _n _utlet _ree.

36-2. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.
36-2. _o _ot _ress _ _esperate _oe _oo _ard.

37. Such is the art of warfare.
37. _uch _s _he _rt _f _arfare.
