VIII. VARIATION IN TACTICS
VIII. V_RI_TION IN T__TI_S

1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In w_r, t__ __n_r_l r___iv_s _is _omm_n_s _rom t__ sov_r_i_n, _oll__ts _is _rmy _n_ _on__ntr_t_s _is _or__s.

2-1. When in difficult country, do not encamp.
2-1. W__n in _i__i_ult _ountry, _o not _n__mp.

2-2. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.

2-5. In desperate position, you must fight.
2-5. In __sp_r_t_ position, you must _i__t.

3. There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
3. T__r_ _r_ ro__s w_i__ must not __ _ollow__, _rmi_s w_i__ must __ not _tt__k__, towns w_i__ must not __ __si____, positions w_i__ must not __ _ont_st__, _omm_n_s o_ t__ sov_r_i_n w_i__ must not __ o__y__.

4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.
4. T__ __n_r_l w_o t_orou__ly un__rst_n_s t__ __v_nt___s t__t ___omp_ny v_ri_tion o_ t__ti_s knows _ow to __n_l_ _is troops.

5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.
5. T__ __n_r_l w_o _o_s not un__rst_n_ t__s_, m_y __ w_ll __qu_int__ wit_ t__ _on_i_ur_tion o_ t__ _ountry, y_t __ will not __ __l_ to turn _is knowl____ to pr__ti__l ___ount.

6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.
6. So, t__ stu__nt o_ w_r w_o is unv_rs__ in t__ _rt o_ w_r o_ v_ryin_ _is pl_ns, _v_n t_ou__ __ __ __qu_int__ wit_ t__ _iv_ __v_nt___s, will __il to m_k_ t__ __st us_ o_ _is m_n.

7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.
7. __n__ in t__ wis_ l____r's pl_ns, _onsi__r_tions o_ __v_nt___ _n_ o_ _is__v_nt___ will __ _l_n___ to__t__r.

8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
8. I_ our _xp__t_tion o_ __v_nt___ __ t_mp_r__ in t_is w_y, w_ m_y su_____ in ___omplis_in_ t__ _ss_nti_l p_rt o_ our s___m_s.

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.
9. I_, on t__ ot__r __n_, in t__ mi_st o_ _i__i_ulti_s w_ _r_ _lw_ys r___y to s_iz_ _n __v_nt___, w_ m_y _xtri__t_ ours_lv_s _rom mis_ortun_.

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.
10. R__u__ t__ _ostil_ __i__s _y in_li_tin_ __m___ on t__m; _n_ m_k_ trou_l_ _or t__m, _n_ k__p t__m _onst_ntly _n_____; _ol_ out sp__ious _llur_m_nts, _n_ m_k_ t__m rus_ to _ny _iv_n point.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
11. T__ _rt o_ w_r t_____s us to r_ly not on t__ lik_li_oo_ o_ t__ _n_my's not _omin_, _ut on our own r___in_ss to r___iv_ _im; not on t__ ___n__ o_ _is not _tt__kin_, _ut r_t__r on t__ ___t t__t w_ __v_ m___ our position un_ss_il__l_.

12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
12. T__r_ _r_ _iv_ __n__rous __ults w_i__ m_y _____t _ __n_r_l: (1) R__kl_ssn_ss, w_i__ l___s to __stru_tion; (2) _ow_r_i__, w_i__ l___s to __ptur_; (3) _ __sty t_mp_r, w_i__ __n __ provok__ _y insults; (4) _ __li___y o_ _onor w_i__ is s_nsitiv_ to s__m_; (5) ov_r-soli_itu__ _or _is m_n, w_i__ _xpos_s _im to worry _n_ trou_l_.

13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.
13. T__s_ _r_ t__ _iv_ __s_ttin_ sins o_ _ __n_r_l, ruinous to t__ _on_u_t o_ w_r.

14-1. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults.
14-1. W__n _n _rmy is ov_rt_rown _n_ its l____r sl_in, t__ __us_ will sur_ly __ _oun_ _mon_ t__s_ _iv_ __n__rous __ults.
