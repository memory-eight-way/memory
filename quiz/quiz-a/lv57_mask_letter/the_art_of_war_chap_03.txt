III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM
III. _TT__K _Y STR_T___M

1-1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
1-1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In t__ pr__ti__l _rt o_ w_r, t__ __st t_in_ o_ _ll is to t_k_ t__ _n_my's _ountry w_ol_ _n_ int__t; to s__tt_r _n_ __stroy it is not so _oo_.

1-2. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
1-2. So, too, it is __tt_r to r___ptur_ _n _rmy _ntir_ t__n to __stroy it, to __ptur_ _ r__im_nt, _ __t___m_nt or _ _omp_ny _ntir_ t__n to __stroy t__m.

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
2. __n__ to _i__t _n_ _onqu_r in _ll your __ttl_s is not supr_m_ _x__ll_n__; supr_m_ _x__ll_n__ _onsists in _r__kin_ t__ _n_my's r_sist_n__ wit_out _i__tin_.

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
3. T_us t__ _i___st _orm o_ __n_r_ls_ip is to __lk t__ _n_my's pl_ns; t__ n_xt __st is to pr_v_nt t__ jun_tion o_ t__ _n_my's _or__s; t__ n_xt in or__r is to _tt__k t__ _n_my's _rmy in t__ _i_l_; _n_ t__ worst poli_y o_ _ll is to __si___ w_ll__ _iti_s.

4-1. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.
4-1. T__ rul_ is, not to __si___ w_ll__ _iti_s i_ it __n possi_ly __ _voi___.

4-2. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.
4-2. T__ pr_p_r_tion o_ m_ntl_ts, mov__l_ s__lt_rs, _n_ v_rious impl_m_nts o_ w_r, will t_k_ up t_r__ w_ol_ mont_s; _n_ t__ pilin_ up o_ moun_s ov_r ___inst t__ w_lls will t_k_ t_r__ mont_s mor_.

5-1. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.
5-1. T__ __n_r_l, un__l_ to _ontrol _is irrit_tion, will l_un__ _is m_n to t__ _ss_ult lik_ sw_rmin_ _nts, wit_ t__ r_sult t__t on_-t_ir_ o_ _is m_n _r_ sl_in, w_il_ t__ town still r_m_ins unt_k_n.

5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
5-2. Su__ _r_ t__ _is_strous _____ts o_ _ si___.

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
6. T__r__or_ t__ skill_ul l____r su__u_s t__ _n_my's troops wit_out _ny _i__tin_; __ __ptur_s t__ir _iti_s wit_out l_yin_ si___ to t__m; __ ov_rt_rows t__ir kin__om wit_out l_n_t_y op_r_tions in t__ _i_l_.

7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
7-1. Wit_ _is _or__s int__t __ will _isput_ t__ m_st_ry o_ t__ _mpir_, _n_ t_us, wit_out losin_ _ m_n, _is triump_ will __ _ompl_t_.

7-2. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
7-2. T_is is t__ m_t_o_ o_ _tt__kin_ _y str_t___m.

8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
8. It is t__ rul_ in w_r, i_ our _or__s _r_ t_n to t__ _n_my's on_, to surroun_ _im; i_ _iv_ to on_, to _tt__k _im; i_ twi__ _s num_rous, to _ivi__ our _rmy into two.

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
9. I_ _qu_lly m_t____, w_ __n o___r __ttl_; i_ sli__tly in__rior in num__rs, w_ __n _voi_ t__ _n_my; i_ quit_ un_qu_l in _v_ry w_y, w_ __n _l__ _rom _im.

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.
10. __n__, t_ou__ _n o_stin_t_ _i__t m_y __ m___ _y _ sm_ll _or__, in t__ _n_ it must __ __ptur__ _y t__ l_r__r _or__.

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.
11. Now t__ __n_r_l is t__ _ulw_rk o_ t__ St_t_; i_ t__ _ulw_rk is _ompl_t_ _t _ll points; t__ St_t_ will __ stron_; i_ t__ _ulw_rk is _____tiv_, t__ St_t_ will __ w__k.

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:--
12. T__r_ _r_ t_r__ w_ys in w_i__ _ rul_r __n _rin_ mis_ortun_ upon _is _rmy:--

13-1. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.
13-1. (1) _y _omm_n_in_ t__ _rmy to __v_n__ or to r_tr__t, __in_ i_nor_nt o_ t__ ___t t__t it __nnot o__y.

13-2. This is called hobbling the army.
13-2. T_is is __ll__ _o__lin_ t__ _rmy.

14-1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
14-1. (2) _y _tt_mptin_ to _ov_rn _n _rmy in t__ s_m_ w_y _s __ __minist_rs _ kin__om, __in_ i_nor_nt o_ t__ _on_itions w_i__ o_t_in in _n _rmy.

14-2. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.
14-2. T_is __us_s r_stl_ssn_ss in t__ sol_i_r's min_s.

15-1. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
15-1. (3) _y _mployin_ t__ o__i__rs o_ _is _rmy wit_out _is_rimin_tion, t_rou__ i_nor_n__ o_ t__ milit_ry prin_ipl_ o_ ___pt_tion to _ir_umst_n__s.

15-2. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
15-2. T_is s__k_s t__ _on_i__n__ o_ t__ sol_i_rs.

16-1. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes.
16-1. _ut w__n t__ _rmy is r_stl_ss _n_ _istrust_ul, trou_l_ is sur_ to _om_ _rom t__ ot__r __u__l prin__s.

16-2. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.
16-2. T_is is simply _rin_in_ _n_r__y into t__ _rmy, _n_ _lin_in_ vi_tory _w_y.

17-1. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
17-1. T_us w_ m_y know t__t t__r_ _r_ _iv_ _ss_nti_ls _or vi_tory: (1) __ will win w_o knows w__n to _i__t _n_ w__n not to _i__t.

17-2. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
17-2. (2) __ will win w_o knows _ow to __n_l_ _ot_ sup_rior _n_ in__rior _or__s.

17-3. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
17-3. (3) __ will win w_os_ _rmy is _nim_t__ _y t__ s_m_ spirit t_rou__out _ll its r_nks.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.
17-4. (4) __ will win w_o, pr_p_r__ _ims_l_, w_its to t_k_ t__ _n_my unpr_p_r__.

17-5. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.
17-5. (5) __ will win w_o __s milit_ry __p__ity _n_ is not int_r__r__ wit_ _y t__ sov_r_i_n.

18-1. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
18-1. __n__ t__ s_yin_: I_ you know t__ _n_my _n_ know yours_l_, you n___ not ___r t__ r_sult o_ _ _un_r__ __ttl_s.

18-2. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
18-2. I_ you know yours_l_ _ut not t__ _n_my, _or _v_ry vi_tory __in__ you will _lso su___r _ _____t.

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
18-3. I_ you know n_it__r t__ _n_my nor yours_l_, you will su__um_ in _v_ry __ttl_.
