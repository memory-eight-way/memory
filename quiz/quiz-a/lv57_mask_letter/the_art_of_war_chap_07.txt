VII. MANEUVERING
VII. M_N_UV_RIN_

1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In w_r, t__ __n_r_l r___iv_s _is _omm_n_s _rom t__ sov_r_i_n.

2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.
2. __vin_ _oll__t__ _n _rmy _n_ _on__ntr_t__ _is _or__s, __ must _l_n_ _n_ __rmoniz_ t__ _i___r_nt _l_m_nts t__r_o_ ___or_ pit__in_ _is __mp.

3-1. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult.
3-1. __t_r t__t, _om_s t__ti__l m_n_uv_rin_, t__n w_i__ t__r_ is not_in_ mor_ _i__i_ult.

3-2. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.
3-2. T__ _i__i_ulty o_ t__ti__l m_n_uv_rin_ _onsists in turnin_ t__ __vious into t__ _ir__t, _n_ mis_ortun_ into __in.

4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.
4. T_us, to t_k_ _ lon_ _n_ _ir_uitous rout_, __t_r _nti_in_ t__ _n_my out o_ t__ w_y, _n_ t_ou__ st_rtin_ __t_r _im, to _ontriv_ to r____ t__ _o_l ___or_ _im, s_ows knowl____ o_ t__ _rti_i__ o_ __VI_TION.

5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.
5. M_n_uv_rin_ wit_ _n _rmy is __v_nt___ous; wit_ _n un_is_iplin__ multitu__, most __n__rous.

6-1. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.
6-1. I_ you s_t _ _ully _quipp__ _rmy in m_r__ in or__r to sn_t__ _n __v_nt___, t__ ___n__s _r_ t__t you will __ too l_t_.

6-2. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.
6-2. On t__ ot__r __n_, to __t___ _ _lyin_ _olumn _or t__ purpos_ involv_s t__ s__ri_i__ o_ its _______ _n_ stor_s.

7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.
7. T_us, i_ you or__r your m_n to roll up t__ir _u__-_o_ts, _n_ m_k_ _or___ m_r___s wit_out __ltin_ __y or ni__t, _ov_rin_ _ou_l_ t__ usu_l _ist_n__ _t _ str_t__, _oin_ _ _un_r__ LI in or__r to wr_st _n __v_nt___, t__ l____rs o_ _ll your t_r__ _ivisions will __ll into t__ __n_s o_ t__ _n_my.

8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.
8. T__ stron__r m_n will __ in _ront, t__ j____ on_s will __ll ___in_, _n_ on t_is pl_n only on_-t_nt_ o_ your _rmy will r____ its __stin_tion.

9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.
9. I_ you m_r__ _i_ty LI in or__r to outm_n_uv_r t__ _n_my, you will los_ t__ l____r o_ your _irst _ivision, _n_ only __l_ your _or__ will r____ t__ _o_l.

10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.
10. I_ you m_r__ t_irty LI wit_ t__ s_m_ o_j__t, two-t_ir_s o_ your _rmy will _rriv_.

11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.
11. W_ m_y t_k_ it t__n t__t _n _rmy wit_out its _______-tr_in is lost; wit_out provisions it is lost; wit_out __s_s o_ supply it is lost.

12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.
12. W_ __nnot _nt_r into _lli_n__s until w_ _r_ __qu_int__ wit_ t__ __si_ns o_ our n_i___ors.

13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country-- its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.
13. W_ _r_ not _it to l___ _n _rmy on t__ m_r__ unl_ss w_ _r_ __mili_r wit_ t__ ____ o_ t__ _ountry-- its mount_ins _n_ _or_sts, its pit__lls _n_ pr__ipi__s, its m_rs__s _n_ sw_mps.

14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.
14. W_ s__ll __ un__l_ to turn n_tur_l __v_nt___ to ___ount unl_ss w_ m_k_ us_ o_ lo__l _ui__s.

15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.
15. In w_r, pr__ti__ _issimul_tion, _n_ you will su_____.

16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.
16. W__t__r to _on__ntr_t_ or to _ivi__ your troops, must __ ___i___ _y _ir_umst_n__s.

17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.
17. L_t your r_pi_ity __ t__t o_ t__ win_, your _omp__tn_ss t__t o_ t__ _or_st.

18. In raiding and plundering be like fire, in immovability like a mountain.
18. In r_i_in_ _n_ plun__rin_ __ lik_ _ir_, in immov__ility lik_ _ mount_in.

19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
19. L_t your pl_ns __ __rk _n_ imp_n_tr__l_ _s ni__t, _n_ w__n you mov_, __ll lik_ _ t_un__r_olt.

20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.
20. W__n you plun__r _ _ountrysi__, l_t t__ spoil __ _ivi___ _mon_st your m_n; w__n you __ptur_ n_w t_rritory, _ut it up into _llotm_nts _or t__ __n__it o_ t__ sol_i_ry.

21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.
21. Pon__r _n_ __li__r_t_ ___or_ you m_k_ _ mov_.

22-1. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.
22-1. __ will _onqu_r w_o __s l__rnt t__ _rti_i__ o_ __vi_tion.

22-2. Such is the art of maneuvering.
22-2. Su__ is t__ _rt o_ m_n_uv_rin_.

23-1. The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums.
23-1. T__ _ook o_ _rmy M_n___m_nt s_ys: On t__ _i_l_ o_ __ttl_, t__ spok_n wor_ _o_s not __rry __r _nou__: __n__ t__ institution o_ _on_s _n_ _rums.

23-2. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.
23-2. Nor __n or_in_ry o_j__ts __ s__n _l__rly _nou__: __n__ t__ institution o_ __nn_rs _n_ _l__s.

24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.
24. _on_s _n_ _rums, __nn_rs _n_ _l__s, _r_ m__ns w__r__y t__ __rs _n_ _y_s o_ t__ _ost m_y __ _o_us__ on on_ p_rti_ul_r point.

25-1. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.
25-1. T__ _ost t_us _ormin_ _ sin_l_ unit__ _o_y, is it impossi_l_ _it__r _or t__ _r_v_ to __v_n__ _lon_, or _or t__ _ow_r_ly to r_tr__t _lon_.

25-2. This is the art of handling large masses of men.
25-2. T_is is t__ _rt o_ __n_lin_ l_r__ m_ss_s o_ m_n.

26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.
26. In ni__t-_i__tin_, t__n, m_k_ mu__ us_ o_ si_n_l-_ir_s _n_ _rums, _n_ in _i__tin_ _y __y, o_ _l__s _n_ __nn_rs, _s _ m__ns o_ in_lu_n_in_ t__ __rs _n_ _y_s o_ your _rmy.

27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.
27. _ w_ol_ _rmy m_y __ ro____ o_ its spirit; _ _omm_n__r-in-__i__ m_y __ ro____ o_ _is pr_s_n__ o_ min_.

28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.
28. Now _ sol_i_r's spirit is k__n_st in t__ mornin_; _y noon__y it __s ___un to _l__; _n_ in t__ _v_nin_, _is min_ is __nt only on r_turnin_ to __mp.

29-1. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.
29-1. _ _l_v_r __n_r_l, t__r__or_, _voi_s _n _rmy w__n its spirit is k__n, _ut _tt__ks it w__n it is slu__is_ _n_ in_lin__ to r_turn.

29-2. This is the art of studying moods.
29-2. T_is is t__ _rt o_ stu_yin_ moo_s.

30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:-- this is the art of retaining self-possession.
30. _is_iplin__ _n_ __lm, to _w_it t__ _pp__r_n__ o_ _isor__r _n_ _u__u_ _mon_st t__ _n_my:-- t_is is t__ _rt o_ r_t_inin_ s_l_-poss_ssion.

31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:-- this is the art of husbanding one's strength.
31. To __ n__r t__ _o_l w_il_ t__ _n_my is still __r _rom it, to w_it _t __s_ w_il_ t__ _n_my is toilin_ _n_ stru__lin_, to __ w_ll-___ w_il_ t__ _n_my is __mis___:-- t_is is t__ _rt o_ _us__n_in_ on_'s str_n_t_.

32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:-- this is the art of studying circumstances.

33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.

34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.

36-2. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.
36-2. _o not pr_ss _ __sp_r_t_ _o_ too __r_.

37. Such is the art of warfare.
37. Su__ is t__ _rt o_ w_r__r_.
