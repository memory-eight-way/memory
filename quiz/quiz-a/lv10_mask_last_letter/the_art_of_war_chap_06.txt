VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG
VI. WEA_ POINT_ AN_ STRON_


1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
1. Su_ Tz_ said_ Whoeve_ i_ firs_ i_ th_ fiel_ an_ await_ th_ comin_ o_ th_ enemy_ wil_ b_ fres_ fo_ th_ fight_ whoeve_ i_ secon_ i_ th_ fiel_ an_ ha_ t_ haste_ t_ battl_ wil_ arriv_ exhausted_

2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
2. Therefor_ th_ cleve_ combatan_ impose_ hi_ wil_ o_ th_ enemy_ bu_ doe_ no_ allo_ th_ enemy'_ wil_ t_ b_ impose_ o_ him_

3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.
3. B_ holdin_ ou_ advantage_ t_ him_ h_ ca_ caus_ th_ enem_ t_ approac_ o_ hi_ ow_ accord_ or_ b_ inflictin_ damage_ h_ ca_ mak_ i_ impossibl_ fo_ th_ enem_ t_ dra_ near_

4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.
4. I_ th_ enem_ i_ takin_ hi_ ease_ h_ ca_ haras_ him_ i_ wel_ supplie_ wit_ food_ h_ ca_ starv_ hi_ out_ i_ quietl_ encamped_ h_ ca_ forc_ hi_ t_ move_

5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.
5. Appea_ a_ point_ whic_ th_ enem_ mus_ haste_ t_ defend_ marc_ swiftl_ t_ place_ wher_ yo_ ar_ no_ expected_

6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.
6. A_ arm_ ma_ marc_ grea_ distance_ withou_ distress_ i_ i_ marche_ throug_ countr_ wher_ th_ enem_ i_ not_

7-1. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.
7-1. Yo_ ca_ b_ sur_ o_ succeedin_ i_ you_ attack_ i_ yo_ onl_ attac_ place_ whic_ ar_ undefended_

7-2. Yo_ ca_ ensur_ th_ safet_ o_ you_ defens_ i_ yo_ onl_ hol_ position_ tha_ canno_ b_ attacked_

8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
8. Henc_ tha_ genera_ i_ skillfu_ i_ attac_ whos_ opponen_ doe_ no_ kno_ wha_ t_ defend_ an_ h_ i_ skillfu_ i_ defens_ whos_ opponen_ doe_ no_ kno_ wha_ t_ attack_

9-1. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!

9-2. Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
9-2. Throug_ yo_ w_ lear_ t_ b_ invisible_ throug_ yo_ inaudible_ an_ henc_ w_ ca_ hol_ th_ enemy'_ fat_ i_ ou_ hands_

10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
10. Yo_ ma_ advanc_ an_ b_ absolutel_ irresistible_ i_ yo_ mak_ fo_ th_ enemy'_ wea_ points_ yo_ ma_ retir_ an_ b_ saf_ fro_ pursui_ i_ you_ movement_ ar_ mor_ rapi_ tha_ thos_ o_ th_ enemy_

11-1. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch.

11-2. Al_ w_ nee_ d_ i_ attac_ som_ othe_ plac_ tha_ h_ wil_ b_ oblige_ t_ relieve_

12-1. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.
12-1. I_ w_ d_ no_ wis_ t_ fight_ w_ ca_ preven_ th_ enem_ fro_ engagin_ u_ eve_ thoug_ th_ line_ o_ ou_ encampmen_ b_ merel_ trace_ ou_ o_ th_ ground_

12-2. Al_ w_ nee_ d_ i_ t_ thro_ somethin_ od_ an_ unaccountabl_ i_ hi_ way_

13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.
13. B_ discoverin_ th_ enemy'_ disposition_ an_ remainin_ invisibl_ ourselves_ w_ ca_ kee_ ou_ force_ concentrated_ whil_ th_ enemy'_ mus_ b_ divided_

14-1. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions.
14-1. W_ ca_ for_ _ singl_ unite_ body_ whil_ th_ enem_ mus_ spli_ u_ int_ fractions_

14-2. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
14-2. Henc_ ther_ wil_ b_ _ whol_ pitte_ agains_ separat_ part_ o_ _ whole_ whic_ mean_ tha_ w_ shal_ b_ man_ t_ th_ enemy'_ few_

15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
15. An_ i_ w_ ar_ abl_ thu_ t_ attac_ a_ inferio_ forc_ wit_ _ superio_ one_ ou_ opponent_ wil_ b_ i_ dir_ straits_

16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.
16. Th_ spo_ wher_ w_ inten_ t_ figh_ mus_ no_ b_ mad_ known_ fo_ the_ th_ enem_ wil_ hav_ t_ prepar_ agains_ _ possibl_ attac_ a_ severa_ differen_ points_ an_ hi_ force_ bein_ thu_ distribute_ i_ man_ directions_ th_ number_ w_ shal_ hav_ t_ fac_ a_ an_ give_ poin_ wil_ b_ proportionatel_ few_

17-1. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.

17-2. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.
17-2. I_ h_ send_ reinforcement_ everywhere_ h_ wil_ everywher_ b_ weak_

18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.
18. Numerica_ weaknes_ come_ fro_ havin_ t_ prepar_ agains_ possibl_ attacks_ numerica_ strength_ fro_ compellin_ ou_ adversar_ t_ mak_ thes_ preparation_ agains_ us_

20-1. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van.
20-1. Bu_ i_ neithe_ tim_ no_ plac_ b_ known_ the_ th_ lef_ win_ wil_ b_ impoten_ t_ succo_ th_ right_ th_ righ_ equall_ impoten_ t_ succo_ th_ left_ th_ va_ unabl_ t_ reliev_ th_ rear_ o_ th_ rea_ t_ suppor_ th_ van_

24. Carefull_ compar_ th_ opposin_ arm_ wit_ you_ own_ s_ tha_ yo_ ma_ kno_ wher_ strengt_ i_ superabundan_ an_ wher_ i_ i_ deficient_

25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.
25. I_ makin_ tactica_ dispositions_ th_ highes_ pitc_ yo_ ca_ attai_ i_ t_ concea_ them_ concea_ you_ dispositions_ an_ yo_ wil_ b_ saf_ fro_ th_ pryin_ o_ th_ subtles_ spies_ fro_ th_ machination_ o_ th_ wises_ brains_

26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics-- that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
26. Ho_ victor_ ma_ b_ produce_ fo_ the_ ou_ o_ th_ enemy'_ ow_ tactics-_ tha_ i_ wha_ th_ multitud_ canno_ comprehend_

27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
27. Al_ me_ ca_ se_ th_ tactic_ whereb_ _ conquer_ bu_ wha_ non_ ca_ se_ i_ th_ strateg_ ou_ o_ whic_ victor_ i_ evolved_
28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
28. D_ no_ repea_ th_ tactic_ whic_ hav_ gaine_ yo_ on_ victory_ bu_ le_ you_ method_ b_ regulate_ b_ th_ infinit_ variet_ o_ circumstances_

29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
29. Militar_ tactic_ ar_ lik_ unt_ water_ fo_ wate_ i_ it_ natura_ cours_ run_ awa_ fro_ hig_ place_ an_ hasten_ downwards_

30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.
30. S_ i_ war_ th_ wa_ i_ t_ avoi_ wha_ i_ stron_ an_ t_ strik_ a_ wha_ i_ weak_

31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
31. Wate_ shape_ it_ cours_ accordin_ t_ th_ natur_ o_ th_ groun_ ove_ whic_ i_ flows_ th_ soldie_ work_ ou_ hi_ victor_ i_ relatio_ t_ th_ fo_ who_ h_ i_ facing_

32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.
32. Therefore_ jus_ a_ wate_ retain_ n_ constan_ shape_ s_ i_ warfar_ ther_ ar_ n_ constan_ conditions_

33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.
33. H_ wh_ ca_ modif_ hi_ tactic_ i_ relatio_ t_ hi_ opponen_ an_ thereb_ succee_ i_ winning_ ma_ b_ calle_ _ heaven-bor_ captain_
