IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS
IV. TACTICA_ DISPOSITION_

1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
1. Su_ Tz_ said_ Th_ goo_ fighter_ o_ ol_ firs_ pu_ themselve_ beyon_ th_ possibilit_ o_ defeat_ an_ the_ waite_ fo_ a_ opportunit_ o_ defeatin_ th_ enemy_

2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
2. T_ secur_ ourselve_ agains_ defea_ lie_ i_ ou_ ow_ hands_ bu_ th_ opportunit_ o_ defeatin_ th_ enem_ i_ provide_ b_ th_ enem_ himself_

3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
3. Thu_ th_ goo_ fighte_ i_ abl_ t_ secur_ himsel_ agains_ defeat_ bu_ canno_ mak_ certai_ o_ defeatin_ th_ enemy_

4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
4. Henc_ th_ saying_ On_ ma_ kno_ ho_ t_ conque_ withou_ bein_ abl_ t_ d_ it_

5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
5. Securit_ agains_ defea_ implie_ defensiv_ tactics_ abilit_ t_ defea_ th_ enem_ mean_ takin_ th_ offensive_

6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.
6. Standin_ o_ th_ defensiv_ indicate_ insufficien_ strength_ attacking_ _ superabundanc_ o_ strength_

7-1. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.
7-1. Th_ genera_ wh_ i_ skille_ i_ defens_ hide_ i_ th_ mos_ secre_ recesse_ o_ th_ earth_ h_ wh_ i_ skille_ i_ attac_ flashe_ fort_ fro_ th_ topmos_ height_ o_ heaven_

7-2. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.
7-2. Thu_ o_ th_ on_ han_ w_ hav_ abilit_ t_ protec_ ourselves_ o_ th_ other_ _ victor_ tha_ i_ complete_

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
8. T_ se_ victor_ onl_ whe_ i_ i_ withi_ th_ ke_ o_ th_ commo_ her_ i_ no_ th_ acm_ o_ excellence_

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
9. Neithe_ i_ i_ th_ acm_ o_ excellenc_ i_ yo_ figh_ an_ conque_ an_ th_ whol_ Empir_ says_ "Wel_ done!_

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
10. T_ lif_ a_ autum_ hai_ i_ n_ sig_ o_ grea_ strength_ t_ se_ th_ su_ an_ moo_ i_ n_ sig_ o_ shar_ sight_ t_ hea_ th_ nois_ o_ thunde_ i_ n_ sig_ o_ _ quic_ ear_

11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
11. Wha_ th_ ancient_ calle_ _ cleve_ fighte_ i_ on_ wh_ no_ onl_ wins_ bu_ excel_ i_ winnin_ wit_ ease_

12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.
12. Henc_ hi_ victorie_ brin_ hi_ neithe_ reputatio_ fo_ wisdo_ no_ credi_ fo_ courage_

13-1. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
13-1. H_ win_ hi_ battle_ b_ makin_ n_ mistakes_

13-2. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
13-2. Makin_ n_ mistake_ i_ wha_ establishe_ th_ certaint_ o_ victory_ fo_ i_ mean_ conquerin_ a_ enem_ tha_ i_ alread_ defeated_

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
14. Henc_ th_ skillfu_ fighte_ put_ himsel_ int_ _ positio_ whic_ make_ defea_ impossible_ an_ doe_ no_ mis_ th_ momen_ fo_ defeatin_ th_ enemy_

15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
15. Thu_ i_ i_ tha_ i_ wa_ th_ victoriou_ strategis_ onl_ seek_ battl_ afte_ th_ victor_ ha_ bee_ won_ wherea_ h_ wh_ i_ destine_ t_ defea_ firs_ fight_ an_ afterward_ look_ fo_ victory_

16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.
16. Th_ consummat_ leade_ cultivate_ th_ mora_ law_ an_ strictl_ adhere_ t_ metho_ an_ discipline_ thu_ i_ i_ i_ hi_ powe_ t_ contro_ success_

17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.
17. I_ respec_ o_ militar_ method_ w_ have_ firstly_ Measurement_ secondly_ Estimatio_ o_ quantity_ thirdly_ Calculation_ fourthly_ Balancin_ o_ chances_ fifthly_ Victory_

18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
18. Measuremen_ owe_ it_ existenc_ t_ Earth_ Estimatio_ o_ quantit_ t_ Measurement_ Calculatio_ t_ Estimatio_ o_ quantity_ Balancin_ o_ chance_ t_ Calculation_ an_ Victor_ t_ Balancin_ o_ chances_

19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.
19. _ victoriou_ arm_ oppose_ t_ _ route_ one_ i_ a_ _ pound'_ weigh_ place_ i_ th_ scal_ agains_ _ singl_ grain_

20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
20. Th_ onrus_ o_ _ conquerin_ forc_ i_ lik_ th_ burstin_ o_ pent-u_ water_ int_ _ chas_ _ thousan_ fathom_ deep_
