III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM
III. ATTAC_ B_ STRATAGE_

1-1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
1-1. Su_ Tz_ said_ I_ th_ practica_ ar_ o_ war_ th_ bes_ thin_ o_ al_ i_ t_ tak_ th_ enemy'_ countr_ whol_ an_ intact_ t_ shatte_ an_ destro_ i_ i_ no_ s_ good_

1-2. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
1-2. So_ too_ i_ i_ bette_ t_ recaptur_ a_ arm_ entir_ tha_ t_ destro_ it_ t_ captur_ _ regiment_ _ detachmen_ o_ _ compan_ entir_ tha_ t_ destro_ them_

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
2. Henc_ t_ figh_ an_ conque_ i_ al_ you_ battle_ i_ no_ suprem_ excellence_ suprem_ excellenc_ consist_ i_ breakin_ th_ enemy'_ resistanc_ withou_ fighting_

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
3. Thu_ th_ highes_ for_ o_ generalshi_ i_ t_ bal_ th_ enemy'_ plans_ th_ nex_ bes_ i_ t_ preven_ th_ junctio_ o_ th_ enemy'_ forces_ th_ nex_ i_ orde_ i_ t_ attac_ th_ enemy'_ arm_ i_ th_ field_ an_ th_ wors_ polic_ o_ al_ i_ t_ besieg_ walle_ cities_

4-1. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.
4-1. Th_ rul_ is_ no_ t_ besieg_ walle_ citie_ i_ i_ ca_ possibl_ b_ avoided_

4-2. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.
4-2. Th_ preparatio_ o_ mantlets_ movabl_ shelters_ an_ variou_ implement_ o_ war_ wil_ tak_ u_ thre_ whol_ months_ an_ th_ pilin_ u_ o_ mound_ ove_ agains_ th_ wall_ wil_ tak_ thre_ month_ more_

5-1. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken.
5-1. Th_ general_ unabl_ t_ contro_ hi_ irritation_ wil_ launc_ hi_ me_ t_ th_ assaul_ lik_ swarmin_ ants_ wit_ th_ resul_ tha_ one-thir_ o_ hi_ me_ ar_ slain_ whil_ th_ tow_ stil_ remain_ untaken_

5-2. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
5-2. Suc_ ar_ th_ disastrou_ effect_ o_ _ siege_

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
6. Therefor_ th_ skillfu_ leade_ subdue_ th_ enemy'_ troop_ withou_ an_ fighting_ h_ capture_ thei_ citie_ withou_ layin_ sieg_ t_ them_ h_ overthrow_ thei_ kingdo_ withou_ length_ operation_ i_ th_ field_

7-1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
7-1. Wit_ hi_ force_ intac_ h_ wil_ disput_ th_ master_ o_ th_ Empire_ an_ thus_ withou_ losin_ _ man_ hi_ triump_ wil_ b_ complete_

7-2. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
7-2. Thi_ i_ th_ metho_ o_ attackin_ b_ stratagem_

8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
8. I_ i_ th_ rul_ i_ war_ i_ ou_ force_ ar_ te_ t_ th_ enemy'_ one_ t_ surroun_ him_ i_ fiv_ t_ one_ t_ attac_ him_ i_ twic_ a_ numerous_ t_ divid_ ou_ arm_ int_ two_

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
9. I_ equall_ matched_ w_ ca_ offe_ battle_ i_ slightl_ inferio_ i_ numbers_ w_ ca_ avoi_ th_ enemy_ i_ quit_ unequa_ i_ ever_ way_ w_ ca_ fle_ fro_ him_

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.
10. Hence_ thoug_ a_ obstinat_ figh_ ma_ b_ mad_ b_ _ smal_ force_ i_ th_ en_ i_ mus_ b_ capture_ b_ th_ large_ force_

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.
11. No_ th_ genera_ i_ th_ bulwar_ o_ th_ State_ i_ th_ bulwar_ i_ complet_ a_ al_ points_ th_ Stat_ wil_ b_ strong_ i_ th_ bulwar_ i_ defective_ th_ Stat_ wil_ b_ weak_

13-2. This is called hobbling the army.

14-1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
14-1. (2_ B_ attemptin_ t_ gover_ a_ arm_ i_ th_ sam_ wa_ a_ h_ administer_ _ kingdom_ bein_ ignoran_ o_ th_ condition_ whic_ obtai_ i_ a_ army_

14-2. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.

15-1. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.

16-1. Bu_ whe_ th_ arm_ i_ restles_ an_ distrustful_ troubl_ i_ sur_ t_ com_ fro_ th_ othe_ feuda_ princes_

16-2. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.
16-2. Thi_ i_ simpl_ bringin_ anarch_ int_ th_ army_ an_ flingin_ victor_ away_

17-1. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.

17-4. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.
17-4. (4_ H_ wil_ wi_ who_ prepare_ himself_ wait_ t_ tak_ th_ enem_ unprepared_

18-1. Henc_ th_ saying_ I_ yo_ kno_ th_ enem_ an_ kno_ yourself_ yo_ nee_ no_ fea_ th_ resul_ o_ _ hundre_ battles_

18-2. I_ yo_ kno_ yoursel_ bu_ no_ th_ enemy_ fo_ ever_ victor_ gaine_ yo_ wil_ als_ suffe_ _ defeat_

18-3. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
