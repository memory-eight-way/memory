IV. T_CT_C_L D_SP_S_T__NS

1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
1. S_n Tz_ s__d: Th_ g__d f_ght_rs _f _ld f_rst p_t th_ms_lv_s b_y_nd th_ p_ss_b_l_ty _f d_f__t, _nd th_n w__t_d f_r _n _pp_rt_n_ty _f d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my.

2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
2. T_ s_c_r_ __rs_lv_s _g__nst d_f__t l__s _n __r _wn h_nds, b_t th_ _pp_rt_n_ty _f d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my _s pr_v_d_d by th_ _n_my h_ms_lf.

3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
3. Th_s th_ g__d f_ght_r _s _bl_ t_ s_c_r_ h_ms_lf _g__nst d_f__t, b_t c_nn_t m_k_ c_rt__n _f d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my.

4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
4. H_nc_ th_ s_y_ng: _n_ m_y kn_w h_w t_ c_nq__r w_th__t b__ng _bl_ t_ d_ _t.

5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
5. S_c_r_ty _g__nst d_f__t _mpl__s d_f_ns_v_ t_ct_cs; _b_l_ty t_ d_f__t th_ _n_my m__ns t_k_ng th_ _ff_ns_v_.

6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.
6. St_nd_ng _n th_ d_f_ns_v_ _nd_c_t_s _ns_ff_c__nt str_ngth; _tt_ck_ng, _ s_p_r_b_nd_nc_ _f str_ngth.

7-1. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.
7-1. Th_ g_n_r_l wh_ _s sk_ll_d _n d_f_ns_ h_d_s _n th_ m_st s_cr_t r_c_ss_s _f th_ __rth; h_ wh_ _s sk_ll_d _n _tt_ck fl_sh_s f_rth fr_m th_ t_pm_st h__ghts _f h__v_n.

7-2. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.
7-2. Th_s _n th_ _n_ h_nd w_ h_v_ _b_l_ty t_ pr_t_ct __rs_lv_s; _n th_ _th_r, _ v_ct_ry th_t _s c_mpl_t_.

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
8. T_ s__ v_ct_ry _nly wh_n _t _s w_th_n th_ k_n _f th_ c_mm_n h_rd _s n_t th_ _cm_ _f _xc_ll_nc_.

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
9. N__th_r _s _t th_ _cm_ _f _xc_ll_nc_ _f y__ f_ght _nd c_nq__r _nd th_ wh_l_ _mp_r_ s_ys, "W_ll d_n_!"

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
10. T_ l_ft _n __t_mn h__r _s n_ s_gn _f gr__t str_ngth; t_ s__ th_ s_n _nd m__n _s n_ s_gn _f sh_rp s_ght; t_ h__r th_ n__s_ _f th_nd_r _s n_ s_gn _f _ q__ck __r.

11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
11. Wh_t th_ _nc__nts c_ll_d _ cl_v_r f_ght_r _s _n_ wh_ n_t _nly w_ns, b_t _xc_ls _n w_nn_ng w_th __s_.

12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.
12. H_nc_ h_s v_ct_r__s br_ng h_m n__th_r r_p_t_t__n f_r w_sd_m n_r cr_d_t f_r c__r_g_.

13-1. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
13-1. H_ w_ns h_s b_ttl_s by m_k_ng n_ m_st_k_s.

13-2. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
13-2. M_k_ng n_ m_st_k_s _s wh_t _st_bl_sh_s th_ c_rt__nty _f v_ct_ry, f_r _t m__ns c_nq__r_ng _n _n_my th_t _s _lr__dy d_f__t_d.

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
14. H_nc_ th_ sk_llf_l f_ght_r p_ts h_ms_lf _nt_ _ p_s_t__n wh_ch m_k_s d_f__t _mp_ss_bl_, _nd d__s n_t m_ss th_ m_m_nt f_r d_f__t_ng th_ _n_my.

15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
15. Th_s _t _s th_t _n w_r th_ v_ct_r___s str_t_g_st _nly s__ks b_ttl_ _ft_r th_ v_ct_ry h_s b__n w_n, wh_r__s h_ wh_ _s d_st_n_d t_ d_f__t f_rst f_ghts _nd _ft_rw_rds l__ks f_r v_ct_ry.

16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.
16. Th_ c_ns_mm_t_ l__d_r c_lt_v_t_s th_ m_r_l l_w, _nd str_ctly _dh_r_s t_ m_th_d _nd d_sc_pl_n_; th_s _t _s _n h_s p_w_r t_ c_ntr_l s_cc_ss.

17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.
17. _n r_sp_ct _f m_l_t_ry m_th_d, w_ h_v_, f_rstly, M__s_r_m_nt; s_c_ndly, _st_m_t__n _f q__nt_ty; th_rdly, C_lc_l_t__n; f__rthly, B_l_nc_ng _f ch_nc_s; f_fthly, V_ct_ry.

18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
18. M__s_r_m_nt _w_s _ts _x_st_nc_ t_ __rth; _st_m_t__n _f q__nt_ty t_ M__s_r_m_nt; C_lc_l_t__n t_ _st_m_t__n _f q__nt_ty; B_l_nc_ng _f ch_nc_s t_ C_lc_l_t__n; _nd V_ct_ry t_ B_l_nc_ng _f ch_nc_s.

19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.
19. _ v_ct_r___s _rmy _pp_s_d t_ _ r__t_d _n_, _s _s _ p__nd's w__ght pl_c_d _n th_ sc_l_ _g__nst _ s_ngl_ gr__n.

20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.
20. Th_ _nr_sh _f _ c_nq__r_ng f_rc_ _s l_k_ th_ b_rst_ng _f p_nt-_p w_t_rs _nt_ _ ch_sm _ th__s_nd f_th_ms d__p.
