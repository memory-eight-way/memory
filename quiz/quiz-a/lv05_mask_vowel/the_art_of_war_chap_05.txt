22-2. F_r _t _s th_ n_t_r_ _f _ l_g _r st_n_ t_ r_m__n m_t__nl_ss _n l_v_l gr__nd, _nd t_ m_v_ wh_n _n _ sl_p_; _f f__r-c_rn_r_d, t_ c_m_ t_ _ st_ndst_ll, b_t _f r__nd-sh_p_d, t_ g_ r_ll_ng d_wn.

23-1. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height.
23-1. Th_s th_ _n_rgy d_v_l_p_d by g__d f_ght_ng m_n _s _s th_ m_m_nt_m _f _ r__nd st_n_ r_ll_d d_wn _ m__nt__n th__s_nds _f f__t _n h__ght.
