VIII. VARIATION IN TACTICS
VIII. V_R__T__N _N T_CT_CS

1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.
1. S_n Tz_ s__d: _n w_r, th_ g_n_r_l r_c__v_s h_s c_mm_nds fr_m th_ s_v_r__gn, c_ll_cts h_s _rmy _nd c_nc_ntr_t_s h_s f_rc_s.

2-1. When in difficult country, do not encamp.
2-1. Wh_n _n d_ff_c_lt c__ntry, d_ n_t _nc_mp.

2-2. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.
2-2. _n c__ntry wh_r_ h_gh r__ds _nt_rs_ct, j__n h_nds w_th y__r _ll__s.

2-3. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.
2-3. D_ n_t l_ng_r _n d_ng_r__sly _s_l_t_d p_s_t__ns.

2-4. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.
2-4. _n h_mm_d-_n s_t__t__ns, y__ m_st r_s_rt t_ str_t_g_m.

2-5. In desperate position, you must fight.
2-5. _n d_sp_r_t_ p_s_t__n, y__ m_st f_ght.

3. There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
3. Th_r_ _r_ r__ds wh_ch m_st n_t b_ f_ll_w_d, _rm__s wh_ch m_st b_ n_t _tt_ck_d, t_wns wh_ch m_st n_t b_ b_s__g_d, p_s_t__ns wh_ch m_st n_t b_ c_nt_st_d, c_mm_nds _f th_ s_v_r__gn wh_ch m_st n_t b_ _b_y_d.

4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.
4. Th_ g_n_r_l wh_ th_r__ghly _nd_rst_nds th_ _dv_nt_g_s th_t _cc_mp_ny v_r__t__n _f t_ct_cs kn_ws h_w t_ h_ndl_ h_s tr__ps.

5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.
5. Th_ g_n_r_l wh_ d__s n_t _nd_rst_nd th_s_, m_y b_ w_ll _cq___nt_d w_th th_ c_nf_g_r_t__n _f th_ c__ntry, y_t h_ w_ll n_t b_ _bl_ t_ t_rn h_s kn_wl_dg_ t_ pr_ct_c_l _cc__nt.

6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.
6. S_, th_ st_d_nt _f w_r wh_ _s _nv_rs_d _n th_ _rt _f w_r _f v_ry_ng h_s pl_ns, _v_n th__gh h_ b_ _cq___nt_d w_th th_ F_v_ _dv_nt_g_s, w_ll f__l t_ m_k_ th_ b_st _s_ _f h_s m_n.

7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.
7. H_nc_ _n th_ w_s_ l__d_r's pl_ns, c_ns_d_r_t__ns _f _dv_nt_g_ _nd _f d_s_dv_nt_g_ w_ll b_ bl_nd_d t_g_th_r.

8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
8. _f __r _xp_ct_t__n _f _dv_nt_g_ b_ t_mp_r_d _n th_s w_y, w_ m_y s_cc__d _n _cc_mpl_sh_ng th_ _ss_nt__l p_rt _f __r sch_m_s.

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.
9. _f, _n th_ _th_r h_nd, _n th_ m_dst _f d_ff_c_lt__s w_ _r_ _lw_ys r__dy t_ s__z_ _n _dv_nt_g_, w_ m_y _xtr_c_t_ __rs_lv_s fr_m m_sf_rt_n_.

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.
10. R_d_c_ th_ h_st_l_ ch__fs by _nfl_ct_ng d_m_g_ _n th_m; _nd m_k_ tr__bl_ f_r th_m, _nd k__p th_m c_nst_ntly _ng_g_d; h_ld __t sp_c___s _ll_r_m_nts, _nd m_k_ th_m r_sh t_ _ny g_v_n p__nt.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
11. Th_ _rt _f w_r t__ch_s _s t_ r_ly n_t _n th_ l_k_l_h__d _f th_ _n_my's n_t c_m_ng, b_t _n __r _wn r__d_n_ss t_ r_c__v_ h_m; n_t _n th_ ch_nc_ _f h_s n_t _tt_ck_ng, b_t r_th_r _n th_ f_ct th_t w_ h_v_ m_d_ __r p_s_t__n _n_ss__l_bl_.

12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
12. Th_r_ _r_ f_v_ d_ng_r__s f__lts wh_ch m_y _ff_ct _ g_n_r_l: (1) R_ckl_ssn_ss, wh_ch l__ds t_ d_str_ct__n; (2) c_w_rd_c_, wh_ch l__ds t_ c_pt_r_; (3) _ h_sty t_mp_r, wh_ch c_n b_ pr_v_k_d by _ns_lts; (4) _ d_l_c_cy _f h_n_r wh_ch _s s_ns_t_v_ t_ sh_m_; (5) _v_r-s_l_c_t_d_ f_r h_s m_n, wh_ch _xp_s_s h_m t_ w_rry _nd tr__bl_.

13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.
13. Th_s_ _r_ th_ f_v_ b_s_tt_ng s_ns _f _ g_n_r_l, r__n__s t_ th_ c_nd_ct _f w_r.

14-1. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults.
14-1. Wh_n _n _rmy _s _v_rthr_wn _nd _ts l__d_r sl__n, th_ c__s_ w_ll s_r_ly b_ f__nd _m_ng th_s_ f_v_ d_ng_r__s f__lts.

14-2. Let them be a subject of meditation.
