VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG
VI. W__K P__NTS _ND STR_NG


1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
1. S_n Tz_ s__d: Wh__v_r _s f_rst _n th_ f__ld _nd _w__ts th_ c_m_ng _f th_ _n_my, w_ll b_ fr_sh f_r th_ f_ght; wh__v_r _s s_c_nd _n th_ f__ld _nd h_s t_ h_st_n t_ b_ttl_ w_ll _rr_v_ _xh__st_d.

2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
2. Th_r_f_r_ th_ cl_v_r c_mb_t_nt _mp_s_s h_s w_ll _n th_ _n_my, b_t d__s n_t _ll_w th_ _n_my's w_ll t_ b_ _mp_s_d _n h_m.

3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.
3. By h_ld_ng __t _dv_nt_g_s t_ h_m, h_ c_n c__s_ th_ _n_my t_ _ppr__ch _f h_s _wn _cc_rd; _r, by _nfl_ct_ng d_m_g_, h_ c_n m_k_ _t _mp_ss_bl_ f_r th_ _n_my t_ dr_w n__r.

4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.
4. _f th_ _n_my _s t_k_ng h_s __s_, h_ c_n h_r_ss h_m; _f w_ll s_ppl__d w_th f__d, h_ c_n st_rv_ h_m __t; _f q___tly _nc_mp_d, h_ c_n f_rc_ h_m t_ m_v_.

5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.
5. _pp__r _t p__nts wh_ch th_ _n_my m_st h_st_n t_ d_f_nd; m_rch sw_ftly t_ pl_c_s wh_r_ y__ _r_ n_t _xp_ct_d.

6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.
6. _n _rmy m_y m_rch gr__t d_st_nc_s w_th__t d_str_ss, _f _t m_rch_s thr__gh c__ntry wh_r_ th_ _n_my _s n_t.

7-1. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.
7-1. Y__ c_n b_ s_r_ _f s_cc__d_ng _n y__r _tt_cks _f y__ _nly _tt_ck pl_c_s wh_ch _r_ _nd_f_nd_d.

7-2. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.
7-2. Y__ c_n _ns_r_ th_ s_f_ty _f y__r d_f_ns_ _f y__ _nly h_ld p_s_t__ns th_t c_nn_t b_ _tt_ck_d.

8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
8. H_nc_ th_t g_n_r_l _s sk_llf_l _n _tt_ck wh_s_ _pp_n_nt d__s n_t kn_w wh_t t_ d_f_nd; _nd h_ _s sk_llf_l _n d_f_ns_ wh_s_ _pp_n_nt d__s n_t kn_w wh_t t_ _tt_ck.

9-1. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!
9-1. _ d_v_n_ _rt _f s_btl_ty _nd s_cr_cy!

9-2. Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
9-2. Thr__gh y__ w_ l__rn t_ b_ _nv_s_bl_, thr__gh y__ _n__d_bl_; _nd h_nc_ w_ c_n h_ld th_ _n_my's f_t_ _n __r h_nds.

10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
10. Y__ m_y _dv_nc_ _nd b_ _bs_l_t_ly _rr_s_st_bl_, _f y__ m_k_ f_r th_ _n_my's w__k p__nts; y__ m_y r_t_r_ _nd b_ s_f_ fr_m p_rs__t _f y__r m_v_m_nts _r_ m_r_ r_p_d th_n th_s_ _f th_ _n_my.

11-1. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch.
11-1. _f w_ w_sh t_ f_ght, th_ _n_my c_n b_ f_rc_d t_ _n _ng_g_m_nt _v_n th__gh h_ b_ sh_lt_r_d b_h_nd _ h_gh r_mp_rt _nd _ d__p d_tch.

11-2. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
11-2. _ll w_ n__d d_ _s _tt_ck s_m_ _th_r pl_c_ th_t h_ w_ll b_ _bl_g_d t_ r_l__v_.

12-1. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.
12-1. _f w_ d_ n_t w_sh t_ f_ght, w_ c_n pr_v_nt th_ _n_my fr_m _ng_g_ng _s _v_n th__gh th_ l_n_s _f __r _nc_mpm_nt b_ m_r_ly tr_c_d __t _n th_ gr__nd.

12-2. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.
12-2. _ll w_ n__d d_ _s t_ thr_w s_m_th_ng _dd _nd _n_cc__nt_bl_ _n h_s w_y.

13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.
13. By d_sc_v_r_ng th_ _n_my's d_sp_s_t__ns _nd r_m__n_ng _nv_s_bl_ __rs_lv_s, w_ c_n k__p __r f_rc_s c_nc_ntr_t_d, wh_l_ th_ _n_my's m_st b_ d_v_d_d.

14-1. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions.
14-1. W_ c_n f_rm _ s_ngl_ _n_t_d b_dy, wh_l_ th_ _n_my m_st spl_t _p _nt_ fr_ct__ns.

14-2. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
14-2. H_nc_ th_r_ w_ll b_ _ wh_l_ p_tt_d _g__nst s_p_r_t_ p_rts _f _ wh_l_, wh_ch m__ns th_t w_ sh_ll b_ m_ny t_ th_ _n_my's f_w.

15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
15. _nd _f w_ _r_ _bl_ th_s t_ _tt_ck _n _nf_r__r f_rc_ w_th _ s_p_r__r _n_, __r _pp_n_nts w_ll b_ _n d_r_ str__ts.

16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.
16. Th_ sp_t wh_r_ w_ _nt_nd t_ f_ght m_st n_t b_ m_d_ kn_wn; f_r th_n th_ _n_my w_ll h_v_ t_ pr_p_r_ _g__nst _ p_ss_bl_ _tt_ck _t s_v_r_l d_ff_r_nt p__nts; _nd h_s f_rc_s b__ng th_s d_str_b_t_d _n m_ny d_r_ct__ns, th_ n_mb_rs w_ sh_ll h_v_ t_ f_c_ _t _ny g_v_n p__nt w_ll b_ pr_p_rt__n_t_ly f_w.

17-1. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.
17-1. F_r sh__ld th_ _n_my str_ngth_n h_s v_n, h_ w_ll w__k_n h_s r__r; sh__ld h_ str_ngth_n h_s r__r, h_ w_ll w__k_n h_s v_n; sh__ld h_ str_ngth_n h_s l_ft, h_ w_ll w__k_n h_s r_ght; sh__ld h_ str_ngth_n h_s r_ght, h_ w_ll w__k_n h_s l_ft.

17-2. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.
17-2. _f h_ s_nds r__nf_rc_m_nts _v_rywh_r_, h_ w_ll _v_rywh_r_ b_ w__k.

18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.
18. N_m_r_c_l w__kn_ss c_m_s fr_m h_v_ng t_ pr_p_r_ _g__nst p_ss_bl_ _tt_cks; n_m_r_c_l str_ngth, fr_m c_mp_ll_ng __r _dv_rs_ry t_ m_k_ th_s_ pr_p_r_t__ns _g__nst _s.

19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.
19. Kn_w_ng th_ pl_c_ _nd th_ t_m_ _f th_ c_m_ng b_ttl_, w_ m_y c_nc_ntr_t_ fr_m th_ gr__t_st d_st_nc_s _n _rd_r t_ f_ght.

20-1. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van.
20-1. B_t _f n__th_r t_m_ n_r pl_c_ b_ kn_wn, th_n th_ l_ft w_ng w_ll b_ _mp_t_nt t_ s_cc_r th_ r_ght, th_ r_ght _q__lly _mp_t_nt t_ s_cc_r th_ l_ft, th_ v_n _n_bl_ t_ r_l__v_ th_ r__r, _r th_ r__r t_ s_pp_rt th_ v_n.

20-2. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!
20-2. H_w m_ch m_r_ s_ _f th_ f_rth_st p_rt__ns _f th_ _rmy _r_ _nyth_ng _nd_r _ h_ndr_d L_ _p_rt, _nd _v_n th_ n__r_st _r_ s_p_r_t_d by s_v_r_l L_!

21-1. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.
21-1. Th__gh _cc_rd_ng t_ my _st_m_t_ th_ s_ld__rs _f Y__h _xc__d __r _wn _n n_mb_r, th_t sh_ll _dv_nt_g_ th_m n_th_ng _n th_ m_tt_r _f v_ct_ry.

21-2. I say then that victory can be achieved.
21-2. _ s_y th_n th_t v_ct_ry c_n b_ _ch__v_d.

22-1. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting.
22-1. Th__gh th_ _n_my b_ str_ng_r _n n_mb_rs, w_ m_y pr_v_nt h_m fr_m f_ght_ng.

22-2. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.
22-2. Sch_m_ s_ _s t_ d_sc_v_r h_s pl_ns _nd th_ l_k_l_h__d _f th__r s_cc_ss.

23-1. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.
23-1. R__s_ h_m, _nd l__rn th_ pr_nc_pl_ _f h_s _ct_v_ty _r _n_ct_v_ty.

23-2. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.
23-2. F_rc_ h_m t_ r_v__l h_ms_lf, s_ _s t_ f_nd __t h_s v_ln_r_bl_ sp_ts.

24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.
24. C_r_f_lly c_mp_r_ th_ _pp_s_ng _rmy w_th y__r _wn, s_ th_t y__ m_y kn_w wh_r_ str_ngth _s s_p_r_b_nd_nt _nd wh_r_ _t _s d_f_c__nt.

25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.
25. _n m_k_ng t_ct_c_l d_sp_s_t__ns, th_ h_gh_st p_tch y__ c_n _tt__n _s t_ c_nc__l th_m; c_nc__l y__r d_sp_s_t__ns, _nd y__ w_ll b_ s_f_ fr_m th_ pry_ng _f th_ s_btl_st sp__s, fr_m th_ m_ch_n_t__ns _f th_ w_s_st br__ns.

26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics-- that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
26. H_w v_ct_ry m_y b_ pr_d_c_d f_r th_m __t _f th_ _n_my's _wn t_ct_cs-- th_t _s wh_t th_ m_lt_t_d_ c_nn_t c_mpr_h_nd.

27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
27. _ll m_n c_n s__ th_ t_ct_cs wh_r_by _ c_nq__r, b_t wh_t n_n_ c_n s__ _s th_ str_t_gy __t _f wh_ch v_ct_ry _s _v_lv_d.
28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
28. D_ n_t r_p__t th_ t_ct_cs wh_ch h_v_ g__n_d y__ _n_ v_ct_ry, b_t l_t y__r m_th_ds b_ r_g_l_t_d by th_ _nf_n_t_ v_r__ty _f c_rc_mst_nc_s.

29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
29. M_l_t_ry t_ct_cs _r_ l_k_ _nt_ w_t_r; f_r w_t_r _n _ts n_t_r_l c__rs_ r_ns _w_y fr_m h_gh pl_c_s _nd h_st_ns d_wnw_rds.

30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.
30. S_ _n w_r, th_ w_y _s t_ _v__d wh_t _s str_ng _nd t_ str_k_ _t wh_t _s w__k.

31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
31. W_t_r sh_p_s _ts c__rs_ _cc_rd_ng t_ th_ n_t_r_ _f th_ gr__nd _v_r wh_ch _t fl_ws; th_ s_ld__r w_rks __t h_s v_ct_ry _n r_l_t__n t_ th_ f__ wh_m h_ _s f_c_ng.

32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.
32. Th_r_f_r_, j_st _s w_t_r r_t__ns n_ c_nst_nt sh_p_, s_ _n w_rf_r_ th_r_ _r_ n_ c_nst_nt c_nd_t__ns.

33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.
33. H_ wh_ c_n m_d_fy h_s t_ct_cs _n r_l_t__n t_ h_s _pp_n_nt _nd th_r_by s_cc__d _n w_nn_ng, m_y b_ c_ll_d _ h__v_n-b_rn c_pt__n.

34-1. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn.
34-1. Th_ f_v_ _l_m_nts (w_t_r, f_r_, w__d, m_t_l, __rth) _r_ n_t _lw_ys _q__lly pr_d_m_n_nt; th_ f__r s__s_ns m_k_ w_y f_r __ch _th_r _n t_rn.

34-2. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.
34-2. Th_r_ _r_ sh_rt d_ys _nd l_ng; th_ m__n h_s _ts p_r__ds _f w_n_ng _nd w_x_ng.
