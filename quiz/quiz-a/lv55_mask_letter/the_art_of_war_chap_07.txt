VII. MANEUVERING
VII. M_N_UV_RING

1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.
1. Sun Tzu s_i_: In w_r, th_ g_n_r_l r___iv_s his _omm_n_s _rom th_ sov_r_ign.

2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.
2. H_ving _oll__t__ _n _rmy _n_ _on__ntr_t__ his _or__s, h_ must _l_n_ _n_ h_rmoniz_ th_ _i___r_nt _l_m_nts th_r_o_ ___or_ pit_hing his __mp.

3-1. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult.
3-1. __t_r th_t, _om_s t__ti__l m_n_uv_ring, th_n whi_h th_r_ is nothing mor_ _i__i_ult.

3-2. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.
3-2. Th_ _i__i_ulty o_ t__ti__l m_n_uv_ring _onsists in turning th_ __vious into th_ _ir__t, _n_ mis_ortun_ into g_in.

4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.
4. Thus, to t_k_ _ long _n_ _ir_uitous rout_, __t_r _nti_ing th_ _n_my out o_ th_ w_y, _n_ though st_rting __t_r him, to _ontriv_ to r___h th_ go_l ___or_ him, shows knowl__g_ o_ th_ _rti_i__ o_ __VI_TION.

5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.
5. M_n_uv_ring with _n _rmy is __v_nt_g_ous; with _n un_is_iplin__ multitu__, most __ng_rous.

6-1. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.
6-1. I_ you s_t _ _ully _quipp__ _rmy in m_r_h in or__r to sn_t_h _n __v_nt_g_, th_ _h_n__s _r_ th_t you will __ too l_t_.

6-2. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.
6-2. On th_ oth_r h_n_, to __t__h _ _lying _olumn _or th_ purpos_ involv_s th_ s__ri_i__ o_ its __gg_g_ _n_ stor_s.

7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.
7. Thus, i_ you or__r your m_n to roll up th_ir _u__-_o_ts, _n_ m_k_ _or___ m_r_h_s without h_lting __y or night, _ov_ring _ou_l_ th_ usu_l _ist_n__ _t _ str_t_h, _oing _ hun_r__ LI in or__r to wr_st _n __v_nt_g_, th_ l____rs o_ _ll your thr__ _ivisions will __ll into th_ h_n_s o_ th_ _n_my.

8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.
8. Th_ strong_r m_n will __ in _ront, th_ j____ on_s will __ll __hin_, _n_ on this pl_n only on_-t_nth o_ your _rmy will r___h its __stin_tion.

9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.
9. I_ you m_r_h _i_ty LI in or__r to outm_n_uv_r th_ _n_my, you will los_ th_ l____r o_ your _irst _ivision, _n_ only h_l_ your _or__ will r___h th_ go_l.

10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.
10. I_ you m_r_h thirty LI with th_ s_m_ o_j__t, two-thir_s o_ your _rmy will _rriv_.

11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.
11. W_ m_y t_k_ it th_n th_t _n _rmy without its __gg_g_-tr_in is lost; without provisions it is lost; without __s_s o_ supply it is lost.

12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.
12. W_ __nnot _nt_r into _lli_n__s until w_ _r_ __qu_int__ with th_ __signs o_ our n_igh_ors.

13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country-- its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.
13. W_ _r_ not _it to l___ _n _rmy on th_ m_r_h unl_ss w_ _r_ __mili_r with th_ ____ o_ th_ _ountry-- its mount_ins _n_ _or_sts, its pit__lls _n_ pr__ipi__s, its m_rsh_s _n_ sw_mps.

14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.
14. W_ sh_ll __ un__l_ to turn n_tur_l __v_nt_g_ to ___ount unl_ss w_ m_k_ us_ o_ lo__l gui__s.

15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.
15. In w_r, pr__ti__ _issimul_tion, _n_ you will su_____.

16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.
16. Wh_th_r to _on__ntr_t_ or to _ivi__ your troops, must __ ___i___ _y _ir_umst_n__s.

17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.
17. L_t your r_pi_ity __ th_t o_ th_ win_, your _omp__tn_ss th_t o_ th_ _or_st.

18. In raiding and plundering be like fire, in immovability like a mountain.
18. In r_i_ing _n_ plun__ring __ lik_ _ir_, in immov__ility lik_ _ mount_in.

19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
19. L_t your pl_ns __ __rk _n_ imp_n_tr__l_ _s night, _n_ wh_n you mov_, __ll lik_ _ thun__r_olt.

20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.
20. Wh_n you plun__r _ _ountrysi__, l_t th_ spoil __ _ivi___ _mongst your m_n; wh_n you __ptur_ n_w t_rritory, _ut it up into _llotm_nts _or th_ __n__it o_ th_ sol_i_ry.

21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.
21. Pon__r _n_ __li__r_t_ ___or_ you m_k_ _ mov_.

22-1. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.
22-1. H_ will _onqu_r who h_s l__rnt th_ _rti_i__ o_ __vi_tion.

22-2. Such is the art of maneuvering.
22-2. Su_h is th_ _rt o_ m_n_uv_ring.

23-1. The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums.
23-1. Th_ _ook o_ _rmy M_n_g_m_nt s_ys: On th_ _i_l_ o_ __ttl_, th_ spok_n wor_ _o_s not __rry __r _nough: h_n__ th_ institution o_ gongs _n_ _rums.

23-2. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.
23-2. Nor __n or_in_ry o_j__ts __ s__n _l__rly _nough: h_n__ th_ institution o_ __nn_rs _n_ _l_gs.

24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.
24. Gongs _n_ _rums, __nn_rs _n_ _l_gs, _r_ m__ns wh_r__y th_ __rs _n_ _y_s o_ th_ host m_y __ _o_us__ on on_ p_rti_ul_r point.

25-1. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.
25-1. Th_ host thus _orming _ singl_ unit__ _o_y, is it impossi_l_ _ith_r _or th_ _r_v_ to __v_n__ _lon_, or _or th_ _ow_r_ly to r_tr__t _lon_.

25-2. This is the art of handling large masses of men.
25-2. This is th_ _rt o_ h_n_ling l_rg_ m_ss_s o_ m_n.

26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.
26. In night-_ighting, th_n, m_k_ mu_h us_ o_ sign_l-_ir_s _n_ _rums, _n_ in _ighting _y __y, o_ _l_gs _n_ __nn_rs, _s _ m__ns o_ in_lu_n_ing th_ __rs _n_ _y_s o_ your _rmy.

27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.
27. _ whol_ _rmy m_y __ ro____ o_ its spirit; _ _omm_n__r-in-_hi__ m_y __ ro____ o_ his pr_s_n__ o_ min_.

28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.
28. Now _ sol_i_r's spirit is k__n_st in th_ morning; _y noon__y it h_s __gun to _l_g; _n_ in th_ _v_ning, his min_ is __nt only on r_turning to __mp.

29-1. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.
29-1. _ _l_v_r g_n_r_l, th_r__or_, _voi_s _n _rmy wh_n its spirit is k__n, _ut _tt__ks it wh_n it is sluggish _n_ in_lin__ to r_turn.

29-2. This is the art of studying moods.
29-2. This is th_ _rt o_ stu_ying moo_s.

30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:-- this is the art of retaining self-possession.
30. _is_iplin__ _n_ __lm, to _w_it th_ _pp__r_n__ o_ _isor__r _n_ hu__u_ _mongst th_ _n_my:-- this is th_ _rt o_ r_t_ining s_l_-poss_ssion.

31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:-- this is the art of husbanding one's strength.
31. To __ n__r th_ go_l whil_ th_ _n_my is still __r _rom it, to w_it _t __s_ whil_ th_ _n_my is toiling _n_ struggling, to __ w_ll-___ whil_ th_ _n_my is __mish__:-- this is th_ _rt o_ hus__n_ing on_'s str_ngth.

32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:-- this is the art of studying circumstances.
32. To r__r_in _rom int_r__pting _n _n_my whos_ __nn_rs _r_ in p_r___t or__r, to r__r_in _rom _tt__king _n _rmy _r_wn up in __lm _n_ _on_i__nt _rr_y:-- this is th_ _rt o_ stu_ying _ir_umst_n__s.

33. It is _ milit_ry _xiom not to __v_n__ uphill _g_inst th_ _n_my, nor to oppos_ him wh_n h_ _om_s _ownhill.

34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.

36-2. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.
36-2. _o not pr_ss _ __sp_r_t_ _o_ too h_r_.

37. Such is the art of warfare.
37. Su_h is th_ _rt o_ w_r__r_.
