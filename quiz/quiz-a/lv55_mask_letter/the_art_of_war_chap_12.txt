XII. TH_ _TT__K _Y _IR_

1-1. Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire.
1-1. Sun Tzu s_i_: Th_r_ _r_ _iv_ w_ys o_ _tt__king with _ir_.

1-2. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.
1-2. Th_ _irst is to _urn sol_i_rs in th_ir __mp; th_ s__on_ is to _urn stor_s; th_ thir_ is to _urn __gg_g_ tr_ins; th_ _ourth is to _urn _rs_n_ls _n_ m_g_zin_s; th_ _i_th is to hurl _ropping _ir_ _mongst th_ _n_my.

2-1. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.
2-1. In or__r to __rry out _n _tt__k, w_ must h_v_ m__ns _v_il__l_.

2-2. Th_ m_t_ri_l _or r_ising _ir_ shoul_ _lw_ys __ k_pt in r___in_ss.

3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.
3. Th_r_ is _ prop_r s__son _or m_king _tt__ks with _ir_, _n_ sp__i_l __ys _or st_rting _ _on_l_gr_tion.

4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.
4. Th_ prop_r s__son is wh_n th_ w__th_r is v_ry _ry; th_ sp__i_l __ys _r_ thos_ wh_n th_ moon is in th_ _onst_ll_tions o_ th_ Si_v_, th_ W_ll, th_ Wing or th_ _ross-__r; _or th_s_ _our _r_ _ll __ys o_ rising win_.

5-1. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments: 6.
5-1. In _tt__king with _ir_, on_ shoul_ __ pr_p_r__ to m__t _iv_ possi_l_ __v_lopm_nts: 6.

5-2. (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.
5-2. (1) Wh_n _ir_ _r__ks out insi__ to _n_my's __mp, r_spon_ _t on__ with _n _tt__k _rom without.

7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.
7. (2) I_ th_r_ is _n out_r__k o_ _ir_, _ut th_ _n_my's sol_i_rs r_m_in qui_t, _i__ your tim_ _n_ _o not _tt__k.

8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.
8. (3) Wh_n th_ _or__ o_ th_ _l_m_s h_s r___h__ its h_ight, _ollow it up with _n _tt__k, i_ th_t is pr__ti___l_; i_ not, st_y wh_r_ you _r_.

9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.
9. (4) I_ it is possi_l_ to m_k_ _n _ss_ult with _ir_ _rom without, _o not w_it _or it to _r__k out within, _ut __liv_r your _tt__k _t _ __vor__l_ mom_nt.

10-1. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it.
10-1. (5) Wh_n you st_rt _ _ir_, __ to win_w_r_ o_ it.

10-2. Do not attack from the leeward.
10-2. _o not _tt__k _rom th_ l__w_r_.

11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.
11. _ win_ th_t ris_s in th_ __ytim_ l_sts long, _ut _ night _r__z_ soon __lls.

12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.
12. In _v_ry _rmy, th_ _iv_ __v_lopm_nts _onn__t__ with _ir_ must __ known, th_ mov_m_nts o_ th_ st_rs __l_ul_t__, _n_ _ w_t_h k_pt _or th_ prop_r __ys.

13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.
13. H_n__ thos_ who us_ _ir_ _s _n _i_ to th_ _tt__k show int_llig_n__; thos_ who us_ w_t_r _s _n _i_ to th_ _tt__k g_in _n ____ssion o_ str_ngth.

14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.
14. _y m__ns o_ w_t_r, _n _n_my m_y __ int_r__pt__, _ut not ro____ o_ _ll his __longings.

15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.
15. Unh_ppy is th_ __t_ o_ on_ who tri_s to win his __ttl_s _n_ su_____ in his _tt__ks without _ultiv_ting th_ spirit o_ _nt_rpris_; _or th_ r_sult is w_st_ o_ tim_ _n_ g_n_r_l st_gn_tion.

16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.
16. H_n__ th_ s_ying: Th_ _nlight_n__ rul_r l_ys his pl_ns w_ll _h___; th_ goo_ g_n_r_l _ultiv_t_s his r_sour__s.

17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.
17. Mov_ not unl_ss you s__ _n __v_nt_g_; us_ not your troops unl_ss th_r_ is som_thing to __ g_in__; _ight not unl_ss th_ position is _riti__l.

18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.
18. No rul_r shoul_ put troops into th_ _i_l_ m_r_ly to gr_ti_y his own spl__n; no g_n_r_l shoul_ _ight _ __ttl_ simply out o_ piqu_.

19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.
19. I_ it is to your __v_nt_g_, m_k_ _ _orw_r_ mov_; i_ not, st_y wh_r_ you _r_.

20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.
20. _ng_r m_y in tim_ _h_ng_ to gl__n_ss; v_x_tion m_y __ su_______ _y _ont_nt.

21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.
21. _ut _ king_om th_t h_s on__ ___n __stroy__ __n n_v_r _om_ _g_in into __ing; nor __n th_ ____ _v_r __ _rought ___k to li__.

22-1. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.
22-1. H_n__ th_ _nlight_n__ rul_r is h____ul, _n_ th_ goo_ g_n_r_l _ull o_ __ution.
