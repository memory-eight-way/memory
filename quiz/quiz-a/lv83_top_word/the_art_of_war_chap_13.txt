11. Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.
11. 

12. Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.
12. 

13. Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.
13. 

14-1. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies.

17.

25-1.
