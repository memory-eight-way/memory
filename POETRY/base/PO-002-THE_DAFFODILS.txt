THE DAFFODILS
BY WILLIAM WORDSWORTH

1. I wandered lonly as a cloud

2. That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

3. When all at once I saw a crowd,

4. A host, of golden daffodils;

5. Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

6. Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.




7. Continuous as the stars that shine

8. And twinkle on the milky way,

9. They stretched in never-ending line

10. Along the margin of a bay:

11. Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

12. Tossing thier heads in sprightly dance.




13. The waves beside them danced; but they

14. Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:

15. A poet could not but be gay,

16. In such a jocund company:

17. I gazed-- and gazed-- but little thought

18. What wealth the show to me had brought:




19. For oft, when on my couch I lie

20. In vacant or in pensive mood,

21. They flash upon that inward eye

22. Which is the bliss of solitude;

23. And then my heart with pleasure fills,

24. And dances with the daffodils.
