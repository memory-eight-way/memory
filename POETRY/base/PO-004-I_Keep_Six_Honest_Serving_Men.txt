I Keep Six Honest Serving Men
BY The Elephant's Child


1. I KEEP six honest serving-men

2. (They taught me all I knew);

3. Their names are What and Why and When

4. And How and Where and Who.

5. I send them over land and sea,

6. I send them east and west;

7. But after they have worked for me,

8. I give them all a rest.



9. I let them rest from nine till five,

10. For I am busy then,

11. As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,

12. For they are hungry men.

13. But different folk have different views;

14. I know a person small--

15. She keeps ten million serving-men,

16. Who get no rest at all!




17. She sends'em abroad on her own affairs,

18. From the second she opens her eyes--

19. One million Hows, two million Wheres,

20. And seven million Whys!
