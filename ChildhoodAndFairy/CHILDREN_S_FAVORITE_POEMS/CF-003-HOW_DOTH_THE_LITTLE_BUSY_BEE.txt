CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE

1. How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour, And gather honey all the day From every opening flow'r!

2. How skilfully she builds her cell!

3. How neat she spreads the wax!

4. And labors hard to store it well With the sweet food she makes.

5. In works of labor or of skill, I would be busy too; For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do.

6. In books, or work, or healthful play, Let my first years be past, That I may give for ev'ry day Some good account at last.

7. ISAAC WATTS
