2. Once or twice though you should fail Try again; If you would at last prevail, Try again.

3. If we strive, 'tis no disgrace Though we may not win the race; What should you do in that case?

4. Try again.

5. If you find your task is hard, Try again; Time will bring you your reward, Try again.

6. All that other folks can do, With your patience should not you?

7. Only keep this rule in view-- Try again.
