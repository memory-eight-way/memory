CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
BED IN SUMMER

1. In winter I get up at night And dress by yellow candle-light.

2. In summer, quite the other way, I have to go to bed by day.

3. I have to go to bed and see The birds still hopping on the tree, Or hear the grown-up people's feet Still going past me in the street.

4. And does it not seem hard to you, When all the sky is clear and blue, And I should like so much to play, To have to go to bed by day?

5. ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
