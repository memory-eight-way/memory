CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
THE VIOLET

1. Down in a green and shady bed A modest violet grew; Its stalk was bent, it hung its head, As if to hide from view.

2. And yet it was a lovely flower, Its color bright and fair; It might have graced a rosy bower Instead of hiding there.

3. Yet there it was content to bloom, In modest tints arrayed; And there diffused its sweet perfume Within the silent shade.

4. Then let me to the valley go, This pretty flower to see, That I may also learn to grow In sweet humility.

5. JANE TAYLOR
