CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
WHERE GO THE BOATS?

1. Dark brown is the river, Golden is the sand.

2. It flows along forever With trees on either hand.

3. Green leaves a-floating, Castles of the foam, Boats of mine a-boating-- Where will all come home?

4. On goes the river And out past the mill, Away down the valley, Away down the hill.

5. Away down the river, A hundred miles or more, Other little children Shall bring my boats ashore.

6. ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
