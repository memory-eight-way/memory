CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
THE WIND

1. I saw you toss the kites on high And blow the birds about the sky; And all around I heard you pass, Like ladies' skirts across the grass-- O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song!

2. I saw the different things you did, But always you yourself you hid.

3. I felt you push, I heard you call, I could not see yourself at all-- O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song!

4. O you that are so strong and cold, O blower, are you young or old?

5. Are you a beast of field and tree, Or just a stronger child than me?

6. O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song!

7. ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
