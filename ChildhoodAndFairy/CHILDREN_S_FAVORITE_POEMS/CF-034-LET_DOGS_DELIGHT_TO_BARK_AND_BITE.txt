CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
LET DOGS DELIGHT TO BARK AND BITE

1. Let dogs delight to bark and bite, For God hath made them so; Let bears and lions growl and fight, For 'tis their nature to; But, children, you should never let Your angry passions rise: Your little hands were never made To tear each other's eyes.

2. Let love through all your actions run, And all your words be mild; Live like the bless?d Virgin's Son,-- That sweet and lovely child.

3. His soul was gentle as a lamb; And as his stature grew, He grew in favor both with man And God his father, too.

4. Now, Lord of all, he reigns above; And from his heavenly throne, He sees what children dwell in love, And marks them for his own.

5. ISAAC WATTS
