FANCIFUL STORIES
SIR LARK AND KING SUN

1. BY GEORGE MACDONALD "Good morrow, my lord!" in the sky alone, Sang the lark as the sun ascended his throne.

2. "Shine on me, my lord; I only am come, Of all your servants, to welcome you home.

3. I have flown right up, a whole hour, I swear, To catch the first shine of your golden hair."

4. "Must I thank you then," said the king, "Sir Lark, For flying so high and hating the dark?

5. You ask a full cup for half a thirst: Half was love of me, and half love to be first.

6. There's many a bird makes no such haste, But waits till I come; that's as much to my taste."

7. And King Sun hid his head in a turban of cloud, And Sir Lark stopped singing, quite vexed and cowed; But he flew up higher, and thought, "Anon The wrath of the king will be over and gone; And his crown, shining out of its cloudy fold, Will change my brown feathers to a glory of gold."

8. So he flew-- with the strength of a lark he flew; But, as he rose, the cloud rose too; And not one gleam of the golden hair Came through the depths of the misty air; Till, weary with flying, with sighing sore, The strong sun-seeker could do no more.

9. His wings had had no chrism of gold; And his feathers felt withered and worn and old; He faltered, and sank, and dropped like a stone.

10. And there on his nest, where he left her, alone Sat his little wife on her little eggs, Keeping them warm with wings and legs.

11. Did I say alone?

12. Ah, no such thing!

13. Full in her face was shining the king.

14. "Welcome, Sir Lark!

15. You look tired," said he; "_Up_ is not always the best way to me.

16. While you have been singing so high and away, I've been shining to your little wife all day."

17. He had set his crown all about the nest, And out of the midst shone her little brown breast; And so glorious was she in russet gold, That for wonder and awe Sir Lark grew cold.

18. He popped his head under her wing, and lay As still as a stone, till King Sun was away.
