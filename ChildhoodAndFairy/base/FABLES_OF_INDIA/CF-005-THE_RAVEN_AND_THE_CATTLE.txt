FABLES OF INDIA
THE RAVEN AND THE CATTLE

1. One evening, as some cattle were wending their way home, a raven rode on the horns of a bull in the herd; and as he approached the cottage, cried to the farmer, "Friend, my work for the day is over; you may now take charge of your cattle."

2. "What was your work?" asked the farmer.

3. "Why," said the raven, "the arduous task of watching these cattle and bringing them home."

4. "Am I to understand you have been doing all the work for me?" said the farmer.

5. "Certainly," said the raven, and flew away with a laugh.

6. Quoth the farmer with surprise, "_How many there are that take credit for things which they have never done_!"
