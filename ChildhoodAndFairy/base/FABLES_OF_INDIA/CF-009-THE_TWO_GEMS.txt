FABLES OF INDIA
THE TWO GEMS

1. A despot in the East once said to his fawning courtiers, "He that goes round my kingdom in the shortest possible time shall have one of these two gems."

2. A courtier went round the King, and said, "Sire, may I have the prize?"

3. "How so?" said the King.

4. "Why, you are the kingdom, are you not?" said the courtier.

5. The despot was so well pleased with the courtier that he gave him both the gems.

6. The other courtiers said, in a whisper, "_Flatterers prey upon fools_."
