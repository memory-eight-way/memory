FABLES OF INDIA
THE BIRDS AND THE LIME

1. A fowler in the East once went to a wood, scattered some grain on the ground, spread a net over it with some lime in it, and was watching from a distance to see what luck would attend his efforts.

2. A great many birds assembled on the trees around the net, and said, "What fine corn that is!

3. We can seldom hope to get anything like it."

4. An owl that was close by said, "How nice that white thing in the net is!"

5. "What is it?" said the birds.

6. "Why, it is our best friend in the world; it is lime.

7. When it holds us in its embrace, we can never hope to get away."

8. The birds left the place at once.

9. Said the fowler, "_A clever bird knows the lime_!"
