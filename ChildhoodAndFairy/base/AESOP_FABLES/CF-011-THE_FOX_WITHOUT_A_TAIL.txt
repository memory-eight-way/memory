AESOP FABLES
THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL

1. A fox lost his tail in escaping from a steel trap.

2. When he began to go about again, he found that every one looked down upon or laughed at him.

3. Not liking this, he thought to himself that if he could persuade the other foxes to cut off their tails, his own loss would not be so noticeable.

4. Accordingly he called together the foxes and said: "How is it that you still wear your tails?

5. Of what use are they?

6. They are in the way, they often get caught in traps, they are heavy to carry and not pretty to look upon.

7. Believe me, we are far better without them.

8. Cut off your tails, my friends, and you will see how much more comfortable it is.

9. I for my part have never enjoyed myself so much nor found life so pleasant as I have since I lost mine."

10. Upon this, a sly old fox, seeing through the trick, cried, "It seems to me, my friend, that you would not be so anxious for us to cut off our tails, if you had not already lost yours."
