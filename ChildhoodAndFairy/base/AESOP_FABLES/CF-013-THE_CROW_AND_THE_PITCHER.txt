AESOP FABLES
THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

1. A crow, whose throat was parched and dry with thirst, saw a pitcher in the distance.

2. In great joy he flew to it, but found that it held only a little water, and even that was too near the bottom to be reached, for all his stooping and straining.

3. Next he tried to overturn the pitcher, thinking that he would at least be able to catch some of the water as it trickled out.

4. But this he was not strong enough to do.

5. In the end he found some pebbles lying near, and by dropping them one by one into the pitcher, he managed at last to raise the water up to the very brim, and thus was able to quench his thirst.
