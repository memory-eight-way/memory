CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
A GOOD PLAY

1. We built a ship upon the stairs All made of the back-bedroom chairs, And filled it full of sofa pillows To go a-sailing on the billows.

2. We took a saw and several nails, And water in the nursery pails; And Tom said, "Let us also take An apple and a slice of cake;"-- Which was enough for Tom and me To go a-sailing on, till tea.

3. We sailed along for days and days, And had the very best of plays; But Tom fell out and hurt his knee, So there was no one left but me.

4. ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
