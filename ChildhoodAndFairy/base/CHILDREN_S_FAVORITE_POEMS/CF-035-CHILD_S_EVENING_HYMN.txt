CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
CHILD'S EVENING HYMN

1. Now the day is over, Night is drawing nigh, Shadows of the evening Steal across the sky.

2. Now the darkness gathers, Stars begin to peep, Birds and beasts and flowers Soon will be asleep.

3. Jesu, give the weary Calm and sweet repose; With thy tenderest blessing May our eyelids close.

4. Grant to little children Visions bright of thee; Guard the sailors tossing On the deep blue sea.

5. Comfort every sufferer Watching late in pain; Those who plan some evil From their sin restrain.

6. Through the long night-watches May thine angels spread Their white wings above me, Watching round my bed.

7. When the morning wakens, Then may I arise Pure and fresh and sinless In thy holy eyes.

8. Glory to the Father, Glory to the Son, And to thee, blessed Spirit, Whilst all ages run.

9.   AMEN.
