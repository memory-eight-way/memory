CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
TWINKLE, TWINKLE

1. Twinkle, twinkle, little star; How I wonder what you are!

2. Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky.

3. When the glorious sun is set, When the grass with dew is wet, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

4. When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

5. In the dark-blue sky you keep, And often through my curtains peep; For you never shut your eye Till the sun is in the sky.

6. As your bright and tiny spark Lights the traveler in the dark, Though I know not what you are, Twinkle, twinkle, little star!
