CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
SUPPOSE!

1. Suppose, my little lady, Your doll should break her head, Could you make it whole by crying Till your eyes and nose are red?

2. And wouldn't it be pleasanter To treat it as a joke, And say you're glad 'twas Dolly's, And not your head that broke?

3. Suppose you're dressed for walking, And the rain comes pouring down, Will it clear off any sooner Because you scold and frown?

4. And wouldn't it be nicer For you to smile than pout, And so make sunshine in the house When there is none without?

5. Suppose your task, my little man, Is very hard to get, Will it make it any easier For you to sit and fret?

6. And wouldn't it be wiser Than waiting, like a dunce, To go to work in earnest And learn the thing at once?

7. Suppose that some boys have a horse, And some a coach and pair, Will it tire you less while walking To say, "It is n't fair?"

8. And would n't it be nobler To keep your temper sweet, And in your heart be thankful You can walk upon your feet?

9. And suppose the world don't please you, Nor the way some people do, Do you think the whole creation Will be altered just for you?

10. And isn't it, my boy or girl, The wisest, bravest plan, Whatever comes, or does n't come, To do the best you can?
