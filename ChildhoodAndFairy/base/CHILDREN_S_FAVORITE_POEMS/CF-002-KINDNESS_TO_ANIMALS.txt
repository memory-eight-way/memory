CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
KINDNESS TO ANIMALS

1. Little children, never give Pain to things that feel and live: Let the gentle robin come For the crumbs you save at home,-- As his meat you throw along He'll repay you with a song; Never hurt the timid hare Peeping from her green grass lair, Let her come and sport and play On the lawn at close of day; The little lark goes soaring high To the bright windows of the sky, Singing as if 'twere always spring, And fluttering on an untired wing,-- Oh!

2. let him sing his happy song, Nor do these gentle creatures wrong.

3. UNKNOWN
