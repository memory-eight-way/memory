CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS
THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE

1. When I was sick and lay a-bed, I had two pillows at my head, And all my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day.

2. And sometimes for an hour or so I watched my leaden soldiers go, With different uniforms and drills, Among the bed-clothes, through the hills; And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up and down among the sheets; Or brought my trees and houses out, And planted cities all about.

3. I was the giant great and still That sits upon the pillow-hill, And sees before him, dale and plain, The pleasant land of counterpane.

4. ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
