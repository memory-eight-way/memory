OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
HARK! HARK! THE LARK

1. Hark!

2. hark!

3. the lark at heaven's gate sings, And Phoebus 'gins arise, His steeds to water at those springs On chaliced flowers that lies; And winking Mary-buds begin To ope their golden eyes; With every thing that pretty bin, My lady sweet, arise; Arise, arise.

4. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
