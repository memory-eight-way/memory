OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE JUVENILE ORATOR

1. You'd scarce expect one of my age To speak in public, on the stage; And if I chance to fall below Demosthenes or Cicero, Don't view me with a critic's eye, But pass my imperfections by.

2. Large streams from little fountains flow; Tall oaks from little acorns grow; And though I now am small and young, Of judgment weak, and feeble tongue, Yet all great learned men-- like me-- Once learned to read their A, B, C.

3. And why may not Columbia's soil Rear men as great as Britain's isle, Exceed what Greece and Rome have done, Or any land beneath the sun?

4. May n't Massachusetts prove as great As any other sister state?

5. Or, where's the town, go far or near, That does not find a rival here?

6. Or, where 's the boy but three feet high Who's made improvement more than I?

7. Those thoughts inspire my youthful mind To be the greatest of mankind; Great, not like C?sar, stained with blood; But only great, as I am good.

8. DAVID EVERETT
