OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE SNOWBIRD'S SONG

1. The ground was all covered with snow one day, And two little sisters were busy at play, When a snowbird was sitting close by on a tree, And merrily singing his chick-a-de-dee, Chick-a-de-dee, chick-a-de-dee, And merrily singing his chick-a-de-dee.

2. He had not been singing that tune very long, Ere Emily heard him, so loud was his song: "Oh, sister, look out of the window," said she; "Here's a dear little bird singing chick-a-de-dee.

3. Chick-a-de-dee, etc.

4. "Oh, mother, do get him some stockings and shoes, And a nice little frock, and a hat if he choose; I wish he'd come into the parlor and see How warm we would make him, poor chick-a-de-dee."

5. Chick-a-de-dee, etc.

6. "There is one, my dear child, though I cannot tell who, Has clothed me already, and warm enough too.

7. Good morning!

8. Oh, who are so happy as we?"

9. And away he went singing his chick-a-de-dee.

10. Chick-a-de-dee, etc.
