OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
SAGE COUNSEL

1. The lion is the beast to fight, He leaps along the plain, And if you run with all your might, He runs with all his mane.

2. I'm glad I'm not a Hottentot, But if I were, with outward cal-lum I'd either faint upon the spot Or hie me up a leafy pal-lum.

3. The chamois is the beast to hunt; He's fleeter than the wind, And when the chamois is in front, The hunter is behind.

4. The Tyrolese make famous cheese And hunt the chamois o'er the chaz-zums: I'd choose the former if you please, For precipices give me spaz-zums.

5. The polar bear will make a rug Almost as white as snow; But if he gets you in his hug, He rarely lets you go.

6. And Polar ice looks very nice, With all the colors of a pris-sum; But, if you'll follow my advice, Stay home and learn your catechis-sum.

7. ARTHUR THOMAS QUILLER-COUCH
