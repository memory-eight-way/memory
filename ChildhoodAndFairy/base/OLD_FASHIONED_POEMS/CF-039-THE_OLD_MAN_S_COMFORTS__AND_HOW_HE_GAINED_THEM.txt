OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE OLD MAN'S COMFORTS, AND HOW HE GAINED THEM

1. "You are old, Father William," the young man cried; "The few locks which are left you are gray; You are hale, Father William-- a hearty old man: Now tell me the reason, I pray."

2. "In the days of my youth,"

3. Father William replied, "I remembered that youth would fly fast, And abused not my health and my vigor at first, That I never might need them at last."

4. "You are old, Father William," the young man cried, "And pleasures with youth pass away; And yet you lament not the days that are gone: Now tell me the reason, I pray."

5. "In the days of my youth,"

6. Father William replied, "I remembered that youth could not last; I thought of the future, whatever I did, That I never might grieve for the past."

7. "You are old, Father William," the young man cried, "And life must be hastening away; You are cheerful, and love to converse upon death: Now tell me the reason, I pray."

8. "I am cheerful, young man,"

9. Father William replied; "Let the cause thy attention engage: In the days of my youth I remembered my God; And he hath not forgotten my age."
