NURSERY RHYMES
TREE ON THE HILL

1. On yonder hill there stands a tree; Tree on the hill, and the hill stood still.

2. And on the tree there was a branch; Branch on the tree, tree on the hill, and the hill stood still.

3. And on the branch there was a nest; Nest on the branch, branch on the tree, tree on the hill, and the hill stood still.

4. And in the nest there was an egg; Egg in the nest, nest on the branch, branch on the tree, tree on the hill, and the hill stood still.

5. And in the egg there was a bird; Bird in the egg, egg in the nest, nest on the branch, branch on the tree, tree on the hill, and the hill stood still.

6. And on the bird there was a feather; Feather on the bird, bird in the egg, egg in the nest, nest on the branch, branch on the tree, tree on the hill, and the hill stood still.
