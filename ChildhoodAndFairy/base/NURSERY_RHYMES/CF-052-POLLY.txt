NURSERY RHYMES
POLLY

1. Brown eyes, straight nose; Dirt pies, rumpled clothes.

2. Torn books, spoilt toys: Arch looks, unlike a boy's; Little rages, obvious arts; (Three her age is), cakes, tarts; Falling down off chairs; Breaking crown down stairs; Catching flies on the pane; Deep sighs-- cause not plain; Bribing you with kisses For a few farthing blisses.

3. Wide-a-wake; as you hear, "Mercy's sake, quiet, dear!"

4. New shoes, new frock; Vague views of what's o'clock When it's time to go to bed, And scorn sublime for what is said Folded hands, saying prayers, Understands not nor cares-- Thinks it odd, smiles away; Yet may God hear her pray!

5. Bed gown white, kiss Dolly; Good night!--that's Polly, Fast asleep, as you see, Heaven keep my girl for me!
