A farmer went trotting

1. A farmer went trotting

2. Upon his gray mare;

3. Bumpety, bumpety, bump!

4. With his daughter behind him,

5. So rosy and fair;

6. Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

7. A raven cried "Croak";

8. And they all tumbled down;

9. Bumpety, bumpety, bump!

10. The mare broke her knees,

11. And the farmer his crown;

12. Lumpety, lumpety, lump.

13. The mischievous raven

14. Flew laughing away;

15. Bumpety, bumpety, bump!

16. And vowed he would serve them

17. The same the next day;

18. Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
