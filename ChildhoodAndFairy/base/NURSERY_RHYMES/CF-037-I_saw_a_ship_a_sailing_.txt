I saw a ship a-sailing,

1. I saw a ship a-sailing,

2. A-sailing on the sea;

3. And it was full of pretty things

4. For baby and for me.

5. There were sweetmeats in the cabin,

6. And apples in the hold;

7. The sails were made of silk,

8. And the masts were made of gold.

9. The four-and-twenty sailors

10. That stood between the decks,

11. Were four-and-twenty white mice.

12. With chains about their necks.

13. The captain was a duck,

14. With a packet on his back;

15. And when the ship began to move,

16. The captain cried, "Quack, quack!"
