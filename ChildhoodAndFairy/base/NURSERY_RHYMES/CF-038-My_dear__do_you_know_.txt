NURSERY RHYMES
My dear, do you know,

1. My dear, do you know,

2. How a long time ago,

3. Two poor little children,

4. Whose names I don't know,

5. Were stolen away on a fine summer's day,

6. And left in a wood, as I've heard people say.

7. And when it was night,

8. So sad was their plight!

9. The sun it went down,

10. And the moon gave no light!

11. They sobbed and they sighed, and they bitterly cried

12. And the poor little things, they lay down and died.

13. And when they were dead,

14. The robins so red,

15. Brought strawberry-leaves

16. And over them spread;

17. And all the day long,

18. They sung them this song:

19. "Poor babes in the wood! Poor babes in the wood!

20. Oh don't you remember the babes in the wood?"
