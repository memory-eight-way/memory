NURSERY RHYMES
Little Bo-peep, she lost her sheep,

1. Little Bo-peep, she lost her sheep,

2. And can't tell where to find them;

3. Leave them alone, and they'll come home,

4. And bring their tails behind them.

5. Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,

6. And dreamed she heard them bleating;

7. When she awoke she found it a joke,

8. For they still were all fleeting.

9. Then up she took her little crook,

10. Determined for to find them;

11. She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,

12. For they'd left their tails behind them!

13. It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray,

14. Unto a meadow hard by--

15. There she espied their tails side by side,

16. All hung on a tree to dry.

17. She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye,

18. And over the hillocks she raced;

19. And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,

20. That each tail should be properly placed.
