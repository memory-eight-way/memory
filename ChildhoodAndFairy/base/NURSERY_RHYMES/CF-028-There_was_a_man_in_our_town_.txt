There was a man in our town,

1. There was a man in our town,

2. And he was wondrous wise,

3. He jumped into a bramble bush,

4. And scratched out both his eyes;

5. But when he saw his eyes were out,

6. With all his might and main,

7. He jumped into another bush,

8. And scratched 'em in again.
