RUSSIAN STORIES
Rover was very soft and downy when he first came to us. But he soon

1. grew to be a big dog.

2. Jock and I taught him many tricks; and he can beg very nicely, if we let him get on the couch in the dining-room.

3. We put sugar on his nose, and he waits until we count One, Two, THREE.

4. Then he throws the sugar into the air and catches it.
