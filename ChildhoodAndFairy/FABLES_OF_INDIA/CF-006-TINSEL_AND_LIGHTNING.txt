FABLES OF INDIA
TINSEL AND LIGHTNING

1. A piece of tinsel on a rock once said to a pebble, "You see how bright I am!

2. I am by birth related to the lightning."

3. "Indeed!" said the pebble; "then accept my humble respects."

4. Some time after, a flash of lightning struck the rock, and the tinsel lost all its brilliancy by the scorching effects of the flash.

5. "Where is your brilliancy now?" said the pebble.

6. "Oh, it is gone to the skies," said the tinsel, "for I have lent it to the lightning that came down a moment ago to borrow it of me."

7. "Dear me!" said the pebble; "_how many fibs doth good bragging need_!"
