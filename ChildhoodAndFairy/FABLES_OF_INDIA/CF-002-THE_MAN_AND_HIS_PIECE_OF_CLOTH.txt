FABLES OF INDIA
THE MAN AND HIS PIECE OF CLOTH

1. A man in the East, where they do not require as much clothing as in colder climates, gave up all worldly concerns and retired to a wood, where he built a hut and lived in it.

2. His only clothing was a piece of cloth which he wore round his waist.

3. But, as ill-luck would have it, rats were plentiful in the wood, so he had to keep a cat.

4. The cat required milk to keep it, so a cow had to be kept.

5. The cow required tending, so a cow-boy was employed.

6. The boy required a house to live in, so a house was built for him.

7. To look after the house a maid had to be engaged.

8. To provide company for the maid a few more houses had to be built, and people invited to live in them.

9. In this manner a little township sprang up.

10. The man said, "_The further we seek to go from the world and its cares, the more they multiply_!"
