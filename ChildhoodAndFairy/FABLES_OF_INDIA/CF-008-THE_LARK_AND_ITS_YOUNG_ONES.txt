FABLES OF INDIA
THE LARK AND ITS YOUNG ONES

1. A child went up to a lark, and said, "Good lark, have you any young ones?"

2. "Yes, child, I have," said the lark; "and they are very pretty ones indeed!"

3. Then she pointed to them, and said, "This is Fair Wing, that is Tiny Bill, and that other is Bright Eye."

4. The child said, "Yes, at home, we are three-- myself and my two sisters, Jane and Alice; and mamma says we are pretty little children, and that she is very fond of us."

5. To this the little larks replied, "Oh yes, mamma is very fond of us too."

6. Then the child said, "Good lark, will you send home Tiny Bill to play with me?"

7. Before the lark could reply, Bright Eye said, "Yes, if you will send little Alice to play with us in our nest."

8. The child said, "Oh, Alice will be so sorry to leave home, and come away from mamma!"

9. Bright.

10. Eye said, "Tiny Bill will be so sorry to leave our nest, and go away from mamma!"

11. The child was abashed, and went home, saying, "_Ah, every one is fond of home_!"
