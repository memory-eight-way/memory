OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
There was a young lady of Niger

1. There was a young lady of Niger

2. Who smiled as she rode on a Tiger;

3. They came back from the ride

4. With the lady inside,

5. And the smile on the face of the Tiger.

6. There was a young maid who said, "Why

7. Can't I look in my ear with my eye?

8. If I give my mind to it,

9. I'm sure I can do it--

10. You never can tell till you try."
