OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THANKSGIVING DAY

1. Over the river and through the wood, To grandfather's house we go; The horse knows the way To carry the sleigh Through the white and drifted snow.

2. Over the river and through the wood-- Oh, how the wind does blow!

3. It stings the toes And bites the nose, As over the ground we go.

4. Over the river and through the wood, To have a first-rate play.

5. Hear the bells ring, "Ting-a-ling-ding!"

6. Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!

7. Over the river and through the wood Trot fast, my dapple-gray!

8. Spring over the ground, Like a hunting-hound!

9. For this is Thanksgiving Day.

10. Over the river and through the wood, And straight through the barn-yard gate We seem to go Extremely slow,-- It is so hard to wait!

11. Over the river and through the wood-- Now grandmother's cap I spy!

12. Hurrah for the fun!

13. Is the pudding done?

14. Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie?

15. LYDIA MARIA CHILD
