OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE VOICE OF SPRING

1. I am coming, I am coming!

2. Hark!

3. the little bee is humming; See, the lark is soaring high In the blue and sunny sky; And the gnats are on the wing, Wheeling round in airy ring.

4. See, the yellow catkins cover All the slender willows over!

5. And on the banks of mossy green Star-like primroses are seen; And, their clustering leaves below, White and purple violets grow.

6. Hark!

7. the new-born lambs are bleating And the cawing rooks are meeting In the elms,--a noisy crowd; All the birds are singing loud; And the first white butterfly In the sunshine dances by.

8. Look around thee, look around!

9. Flowers in all the fields abound; Every running stream is bright; All the orchard trees are white; And each small and waving shoot Promises sweet flowers and fruit.
