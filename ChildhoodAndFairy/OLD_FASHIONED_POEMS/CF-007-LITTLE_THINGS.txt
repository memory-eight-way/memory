OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
LITTLE THINGS

1. Little drops of water Little grains of sand, Make the mighty ocean, And the pleasant land.

2. Thus the little moments, Humble though they be, Make the mighty ages Of eternity.

3. Thus our little errors Lead the soul away From the path of virtue, Off in sin to stray.

4. Little deeds of kindness, Little words of love, Make our earth an Eden, Like the heaven above.

5. Ascribed to JULIA A.
