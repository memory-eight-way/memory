OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
SONG OF LIFE

1. A traveller on a dusty road Strewed acorns on the lea; And one took root and sprouted up, And grew into a tree.

2. Love sought its shade at evening-time, To breathe its early vows; And Age was pleased, in heights of noon, To bask beneath its boughs.

3. The dormouse loved its dangling twigs, The birds sweet music bore-- It stood a glory in its place, A blessing evermore.

4. A little spring had lost its way Amid the grass and fern; A passing stranger scooped a well Where weary men might turn, He walled it in, and hung with care A ladle on the brink; He thought not of the deed he did, But judged that Toil might drink.

5. He passed again; and lo!

6. the well, By summer never dried, Had cooled ten thousand parch?d tongues, And saved a life beside.

7. A nameless man, amid the crowd That thronged the daily mart, Let fall a word of hope and love, Unstudied from the heart, A whisper on the tumult thrown, A transitory breath, It raised a brother from the dust, It saved a soul from death.

8. O germ!

9. O fount!

10. O word of love!

11. O thought at random cast!

12. Ye were but little at the first, But mighty at the last.

13. CHARLES MACKAY
