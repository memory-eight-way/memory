OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE MAGPIE'S NEST

1. A FABLE When the Arts in their infancy were, In a fable of old 'tis express'd A wise magpie constructed that rare Little house for young birds, call'd a nest.

2. This was talk'd of the whole country round; You might hear it on every bough sung, "Now no longer upon the rough ground Will fond mothers brood over their young:"

3. "For the magpie with exquisite skill Has invented a moss-cover'd cell Within which a whole family will In the utmost security dwell."

4. UNKNOWN
