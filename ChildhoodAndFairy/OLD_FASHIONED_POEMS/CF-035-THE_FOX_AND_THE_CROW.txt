OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE FOX AND THE CROW

1. The fox and the crow, In prose, I well know, Many good little girls can rehearse: Perhaps it will tell Pretty nearly as well, If we try the same fable in verse.

2. In a dairy a crow, Having ventured to go, Some food for her young ones to seek, Flew up in the trees, With a fine piece of cheese, Which she joyfully held in her beak.

3. A fox, who lived by, To the tree saw her fly, And to share in the prize made a vow; For having just dined, He for cheese felt inclined, So he went and sat under the bough.

4. She was cunning, he knew, But so was he too, And with flattery adapted his plan; For he knew if she'd speak, It must fall from her beak, So, bowing politely, began.

5. "'T is a very fine day" (Not a word did she say): "The wind, I believe, ma'am, is south: A fine harvest for peas:"

6. He then looked at the cheese, But the crow did not open her mouth.

7. Sly Reynard, not tired, Her plumage admired, "How charming!

8. how brilliant its hue!

9. The voice must be fine, Of a bird so divine, Ah, let me just hear it, pray do.

10. "Believe me, I long To hear a sweet song!"

11. The silly crow foolishly tries: She scarce gave one squall, When the cheese she let fall, And the fox ran away with the prize.
