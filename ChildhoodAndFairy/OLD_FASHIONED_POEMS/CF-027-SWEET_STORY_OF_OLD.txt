OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
SWEET STORY OF OLD

1. I think when I read that sweet story of old, When Jesus was here among men, How He call'd little children as lambs to His fold, I should like to have been with them then.

2. I wish that His hands had been placed on my head, That His arm had been thrown around me, And that I might have seen His kind look when He said, "Let the little ones come unto me."

3. Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go, And ask for a share in His love; And if I thus earnestly seek Him below, I shall see Him and hear Him above; In that beautiful place He has gone to prepare For all who are washed and forgiven; And many dear children shall be with Him there, For of such is the kingdom of heaven.

4. But thousands and thousands who wander and fall, Never heard of that heavenly home; I wish they could know there is room for them all, And that Jesus has bid them to come.

5. JEMIMA LUKE
