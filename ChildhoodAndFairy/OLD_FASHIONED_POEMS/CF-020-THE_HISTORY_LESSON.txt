OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE HISTORY LESSON

1. There was a monkey climbed up a tree, When he fell down, then down fell he.

2. There was a crow sat on a stone, When he was gone, then there was none.

3. There was an old wife did eat an apple, When she had eat two, she had eat a couple.

4. There was a horse going to the mill, When he went on, he stood not still.

5. There was a butcher cut his thumb, When it did bleed, then blood did come.

6. There was a lackey ran a race, When he ran fast, he ran apace.

7. There was a cobbler clouting shoon, When they were mended, they were done.

8. There was a chandler making candle, When he them strip, he did them handle.

9. There was a navy went into Spain, When it returned, it came again.
