OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
THE GRAVES OF A HOUSEHOLD

1. They grew in beauty, side by side, They filled one home with glee; Their graves are severed far and wide, By mount, and stream, and sea.

2. The same fond mother bent at night O'er each fair, sleeping brow; She had each folded flower in sight: Where are those sleepers now?

3. One, midst the forest of the West, By a dark stream is laid; The Indian knows his place of rest, Far in the cedar shade.

4. The sea, the blue, lone sea, hath one; He lies where pearls lie deep; He was the loved of all, yet none O'er his low bed may weep.

5. One sleeps where southern vines are dressed Above the noble slain; He wrapped the colors round his breast On a blood-red field of Spain.

6. And one-- o'er her the myrtle showers Its leaves by soft winds fanned; She faded midst Italian flowers-- The last of that fair band.

7. And parted thus, they rest who played Beneath the same green tree; Whose voices mingled as they prayed Around one parent knee.

8. They that with smiles lit up the hall, And cheered with song the hearth; Alas for love!

9. if thou wert all, And naught beyond, O earth!
