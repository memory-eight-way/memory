OLD-FASHIONED POEMS
FOR A' THAT AND A' THAT

1. Is there for honest poverty Wha hangs his head, and a' that?

2. The coward slave, we pass him by; We dare be poor for a' that.

3. For a' that, and a' that, Our toils obscure, and a' that; The rank is but the guinea's stamp,-- The man's the gowd for a' that.

4. What though on hamely fare we dine, Wear hoddin gray, and a' that?

5. Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,-- A man's a man for a' that.

6. For a' that, and a' that, Their tinsel show, and a' that; The honest man, though e'er sae poor, Is king o' men for a' that.

7. Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord, Wha struts, and stares, and a' that-- Though hundreds worship at his word, He's but a coof for a' that; For a' that, and a' that, His riband, star, and a' that; The man of independent mind, He looks and laughs at a' that.

8. A prince can mak a belted knight, A marquis, duke, and a' that; But an honest man's aboon his might,-- Guid faith, he maunna fa' that!

9. For a' that, and a' that; Their dignities, and a' that, The pith o' sense, and pride o' worth, Are higher ranks than a' that.

10. Then let us pray that come it may,-- As come it will for a' that,-- That sense and worth, o'er a' the earth, May bear the gree, and a' that.

11. For a' that, and a' that, It's coming yet, for a' that,-- When man to man, the warld o'er, Shall brothers be for a' that!

12. ROBERT BURNS
