NURSERY RHYMES
Sleep, baby, sleep!

1. Sleep, baby, sleep!

2. Thy father watches the sheep;

3. Thy mother is shaking the dream-land tree,

4. And down falls a little dream on thee:

5. Sleep, baby, sleep!

6. Sleep, baby, sleep.

7. The large stars are the sheep,

8. The wee stars are the lambs, I guess,

9. The fair moon is the shepherdess:

10. Sleep, baby, sleep!
