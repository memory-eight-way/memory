I had a little husband,

1. I had a little husband,

2. No bigger than my thumb;

3. I put him in a pint-pot,

4. And there I bade him drum.

5. I bought a little horse,

6. That galloped up and down;

7. I bridled him, and saddled

8. And sent him out of town.

9. I gave him little garters,

10. To garter up his hose,

11. And a little handkerchief,

12. To wipe his little nose.
