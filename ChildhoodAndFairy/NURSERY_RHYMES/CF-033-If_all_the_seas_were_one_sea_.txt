NURSERY RHYMES
If all the seas were one sea,

1. If all the seas were one sea,

2. What a _great_ sea that would be!

3. And if all the trees were one tree,

4. What a _great_ tree that would be!

5. And if all the axes were one axe,

6. What a _great_ axe that would be!

7. And if all the men were one man,

8. What a _great_ man he would be!

9. And if the _great_ man took the _great_ axe,

10. And cut down the _great_ tree,

11. And let it fall into the _great_ sea,

12. What a splish splash _that_ would be!
