The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts

1. The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts

2. All on a summer's day;

3. The Knave of Hearts, he stole the tarts,

4. And took them clean away.

5. The King of Hearts called for the tarts,

6. And beat the Knave full sore;

7. The Knave of Hearts brought back the tarts,

8. And vowed he'd steal no more.
