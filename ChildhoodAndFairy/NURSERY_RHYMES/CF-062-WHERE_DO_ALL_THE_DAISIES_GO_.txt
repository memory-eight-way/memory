WHERE DO ALL THE DAISIES GO?

1. Where do all the daisies go?

2. I know, I know!

3. Underneath the snow they creep, Nod their little heads and sleep, In the springtime out they peep; That is where they go!

4. Where do all the birdies go?

5. I know, I know!

6. Far away from winter snow To the fair, warm South they go; There they stay till daisies blow, That is where they go!

7. Where do all the babies go?

8. I know, I know!

9. In the glancing firelight warm, Safely sheltered from all harm, Soft they lie on mother's arm, That is where they go!
