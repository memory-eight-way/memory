NURSERY RHYMES
THE ORPHAN'S SONG

1. I had a little bird, I took it from the nest; I prest it and blest it, And nurst it in my breast.

2. I set it on the ground, Danced round and round, And sang about it so cheerly, With "Hey, my little bird, And ho!

3. my little bird, And oh!

4. but I love thee dearly!"

5. I make a little feast Of food soft and sweet, I hold it in my breast, And coax it to eat; I pit, and I pat, I call this and that, And I sing about so cheerly, With "Hey, my little bird, And ho!

6. my little bird, And oh!

7. but I love thee dearly!"

8. SYDNEY DOBELL
