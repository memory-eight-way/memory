TELL US A TALE

1. BY EDWARD SHIRLEY "Tell us a tale, dear mother-- A fairy tale, do, please, Take baby brother on your lap, We'll sit beside your knees, We will not speak, we will not stir, Until the tale is told; And we'll be, oh!

5. Or shall I tell the story Of Puss in Boots-- the scamp?

6. Or would you like to hear the tale Of Blue Beard, fierce and grim?

7. Or Jack who climbed the great beanstalk?-- I think you're fond of him.

8. "Or shall I tell you, children, About Red Riding Hood?

9. Or what befell those little Babes Who wandered in the Wood?

10. Or how sweet Cinderella went So gaily to the ball?"

11. "Yes, yes!" we cried, and clapped our hands; "_We want to hear them all_!"
