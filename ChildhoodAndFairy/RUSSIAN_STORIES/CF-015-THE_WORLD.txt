RUSSIAN STORIES
THE WORLD

1. "The world is wet," said the little frog; "What isn't water is mostly bog."

2. "Oh, not at all!" said the little fly; "It's full of spiders, and very dry!"

3. "The world is dark," said the moth polite, "With ruddy windows and bows of light."

4. "My poor young friend, you have much to learn: The world is green," said the swaying fern.

5. "O listen to me," sang the little lark: "It's wet and dry, and it's green and dark.

6. To think that's all would be very wrong; It's arched with blue, and it's filled with song."
