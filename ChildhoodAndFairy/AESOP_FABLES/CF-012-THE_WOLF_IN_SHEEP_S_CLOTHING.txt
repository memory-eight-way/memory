AESOP FABLES
THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING

1. A wolf put on the skin of a sheep, and getting in among the flock by means of this disguise, killed many of the sheep.

2. The shepherd, who wondered why so many of his flock had disappeared, at last discovered the deceit.

3. He fastened a rope cunningly round the pretended sheep's neck, led him to a tree, and there hanged him.

4. Some other shepherds passing that way and seeing what they thought was a sheep hanging from a tree, said, "What, brother!

5. Surely you do not hang sheep?"

6. "No," answered the shepherd, "but I hang wolves when I catch them dressed up in sheep's skins!"

7. Then he showed them their mistake, and they praised the justice of the deed he had done.
