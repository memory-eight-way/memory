AESOP FABLES
THE CAT, THE MONKEY, AND THE CHESTNUTS

1. A cat and a monkey were sitting one day in the chimney corner watching some chestnuts which their master had laid down to roast in the ashes.

2. The chestnuts had begun to burst with the heat, and the monkey said to the cat, "It is plain that your paws were made especially for pulling out those chestnuts.

3. Do you reach forth and draw them out.

4. Your paws are, indeed, exactly like our master's hands."

5. The cat was greatly flattered by this speech, and reached forward for the tempting chestnuts, but scarcely had he touched the hot ashes than he drew back with a cry, for he had burnt his paw; but he tried again, and managed to pull one chestnut out; then he pulled another, and a third, though each time he singed the hair on his paws.

6. When he could pull no more out he turned about and found that the monkey had taken the time to crack the chestnuts and eat them.
