AESOP FABLES
THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE

1. "What a dull, heavy creature," says the Hare, "is this Tortoise!"

2. "And yet," says the Tortoise, "I'll run with you for a wager."

3. "Done," says the Hare, and then they asked the Fox to be the judge.

4. They started together, and the Tortoise kept jogging on still, till he came to the end of the course.

5. The Hare laid himself down midway and took a nap; "for," says he, "I can catch up with the Tortoise when I please."

6. But it seems he overslept himself, for when he came to wake, though he scudded away as fast as possible, the Tortoise had got to the post before him and won the wager.

7. Slow and steady wins the race.
