AESOP FABLES
THE GOOSE THAT LAID GOLDEN EGGS

1. There was a man who once had a very handsome goose, that always laid golden eggs.

2. Now, he thought there must be gold inside of her, so he wrung her neck straightway, and found she was exactly like all other geese.

3. He thought to find riches, and lost the little he had.

4. The fable teaches that one who has anything should be content with it, and avoid covetousness, lest he lose what he has.
