The Wolf And The Lamb

WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay
violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the
WolfÅfs right to eat him. He thus addressed him: ÅgSirrah, last year you
grossly insulted me.Åh ÅgIndeed,Åh bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone
of voice, ÅgI was not then born.Åh Then said the Wolf, ÅgYou feed in my
pasture.Åh ÅgNo, good sir,Åh replied the Lamb, ÅgI have not yet tasted
grass.Åh Again said the Wolf, ÅgYou drink of my well.Åh ÅgNo,Åh exclaimed the
Lamb, ÅgI never yet drank water, for as yet my motherÅfs milk is both food
and drink to me.Åh Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
ÅgWell! I wonÅft remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my
imputations.Åh The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

The Bat And The Weasels

A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be
spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the
enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a
mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to
the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated
not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to
mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a
second time escaped.

It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.

The Ass And The Grasshopper

AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted;
and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort
of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied,
ÅgThe dew.Åh The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a
short time died of hunger.
