1. It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great university towns, and it was during this time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to relate befell us.

2. It will be obvious that any details which would help the reader exactly to identify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive.

3. So painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out.

4. With due discretion the incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable.

5. I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.

6. We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early English charters-- researches which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives.

7. Here it was that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton Soames, tutor and lecturer at the College of St. Luke's.

8. Mr. Soames was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament.

9. I had always known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred.

10. "I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time.

11. We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke's, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in town, I should have been at a loss what to do."

12. "I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions," my friend answered.

13. "I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police."

14. "No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible.

15. When once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most essential to avoid scandal.

16. Your discretion is as well known as your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me.

17. I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can."

18. My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.

19. Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.

20. He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.

21. "I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship.

22. I am one of the examiners.

23. My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists of a large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not seen.

24. This passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance.

25. For this reason, great care is taken to keep the paper secret.

26. "To-day, about three o'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers.

27. The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides.

28. I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct.

29. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed.

30. I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk.

31. I was absent rather more than an hour.

32. "You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double-- a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without.

33. As I approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it.

34. For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right.

35. The only duplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister-- a man who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion.

36. I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out.

37. His visit to my room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it.

38. His forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable consequences.

39. "The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.

40. The proof was in three long slips.

41. I had left them all together.

42. Now, I found that one of them was lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third was where I had left it."

43. Holmes stirred for the first time.

44. "The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it," said he.

45. "Exactly, Mr. Holmes.

46. You amaze me.

47. How could you possibly know that?"

48. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

49. "For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers.

50. He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth.

51. The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.

52. A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.

53. "Bannister was very much upset by the incident.

54. He had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with.

55. I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of the room.

56. I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers.

57. On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened.

58. A broken tip of lead was lying there also.

59. Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it."

60. "Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.

61. "Fortune has been your friend."

62. "This was not all.

63. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of red leather.

64. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained.

65. Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long-- not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.

66. Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.

67. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers.

68. There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity.

69. I was at my wit's end, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands.

70. Do help me, Mr. Holmes.

71. You see my dilemma.

72. Either I must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation, there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not only on the college, but on the university.

73. Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly."

74. "I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as I can," said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat.

75. "The case is not entirely devoid of interest.

76. Had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you?"

77. "Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student, who lives on the same stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the examination."

78. "For which he was entered?"

79. "Yes."

80. "And the papers were on your table?"

81. "To the best of my belief, they were rolled up."

82. "But might be recognized as proofs?"

83. "Possibly."

84. "No one else in your room?"

85. "No."

86. "Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?"

87. "No one save the printer."

88. "Did this man Bannister know?"

89. "No, certainly not.

90. No one knew."

91. "Where is Bannister now?"

92. "He was very ill, poor fellow.

93. I left him collapsed in the chair.

94. I was in such a hurry to come to you."

95. "You left your door open?"

96. "I locked up the papers first."

97. "Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames: that, unless the Indian student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there."

98. "So it seems to me."

99. Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.

100. "Well," said he, "let us go round.

101. Not one of your cases, Watson-- mental, not physical.

102. All right; come if you want to.

103. Now, Mr. Soames-- at your disposal!"

104. The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college.

105. A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase.

106. On the ground floor was the tutor's room.

107. Above were three students, one on each story.

108. It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem.

109. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window.

110. Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.

111. "He must have entered through the door.

112. There is no opening except the one pane," said our learned guide.

113. "Dear me!" said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced at our companion.

114. "Well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had best go inside."

115. The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room.

116. We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.

117. "I am afraid there are no signs here," said he.

118. "One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.

119. Your servant seems to have quite recovered.

120. You left him in a chair, you say.

121. Which chair?"

122. "By the window there."

123. "I see.

124. Near this little table.

125. You can come in now.

126. I have finished with the carpet.

127. Let us take the little table first.

128. Of course, what has happened is very clear.

129. The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.

130. He carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape."

131. "As a matter of fact, he could not," said Soames, "for I entered by the side door."

132. "Ah, that's good!

133. Well, anyhow, that was in his mind.

134. Let me see the three strips.

135. No finger impressions-- no!

136. Well, he carried over this one first, and he copied it.

137. How long would it take him to do that, using every possible contraction?

138. A quarter of an hour, not less.

139. Then he tossed it down and seized the next.

140. He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat-- VERY hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.

141. You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door?"

142. "No, I can't say I was."

143. "Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again.

144. This is of interest, Watson.

145. The pencil was not an ordinary one.

146. It was above the usual size, with a soft lead, the outer colour was dark blue, the maker's name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half long.

147. Look for such a pencil, Mr. Soames, and you have got your man.

148. When I add that he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an additional aid."

149. Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.

150. "I can follow the other points," said he, "but really, in this matter of the length----"

151. Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space of clear wood after them.

152. "You see?"

153. "No, I fear that even now----"

154. "Watson, I have always done you an injustice.

155. There are others.

156. What could this NN be?

157. It is at the end of a word.

158. You are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name.

159. Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?"

160. He held the small table sideways to the electric light.

161. "I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.

162. No, I see nothing.

163. I don't think there is anything more to be learned here.

164. Now for the central table.

165. This small pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of.

166. Roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive.

167. As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it.

168. Dear me, this is very interesting.

169. And the cut-- a positive tear, I see.

170. It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole.

171. I am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr. Soames.

172. Where does that door lead to?"

173. "To my bedroom."

174. "Have you been in it since your adventure?"

175. "No, I came straight away for you."

176. "I should like to have a glance round.

177. What a charming, old-fashioned room!

178. Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until I have examined the floor.

179. No, I see nothing.

180. What about this curtain?

181. You hang your clothes behind it.

182. If anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow.

183. No one there, I suppose?"

184. As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an emergency.

185. As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs.

186. Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor.

187. "Halloa!

188. What's this?" said he.

189. It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study.

190. Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.

191. "Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sitting-room, Mr. Soames."

192. "What could he have wanted there?"

193. "I think it is clear enough.

194. You came back by an unexpected way, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door.

195. What could he do?

196. He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself."

197. "Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all the time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man prisoner if we had only known it?"

198. "So I read it."

199. "Surely there is another alternative, Mr. Holmes.

200. I don't know whether you observed my bedroom window?"

201. "Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man."

202. "Exactly.

203. And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible.

204. The man might have effected his entrance there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally, finding the door open, have escaped that way."

205. Holmes shook his head impatiently.

206. "Let us be practical," said he.

207. "I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door?"

208. "Yes, there are."

209. "And they are all in for this examination?"

210. "Yes."

211. "Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others?"

212. Soames hesitated.

213. "It is a very delicate question," said he.

214. "One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs."

215. "Let us hear the suspicions.

216. I will look after the proofs."

217. "I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms.

218. The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete, plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump.

219. He is a fine, manly fellow.

220. His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf.

221. My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious.

222. He will do well.

223. "The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian.

224. He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are.

225. He is well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject.

226. He is steady and methodical.

227. "The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren.

228. He is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work-- one of the brightest intellects of the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled.

229. He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year.

230. He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to the examination."

231. "Then it is he whom you suspect?"

232. "I dare not go so far as that.

233. But, of the three, he is perhaps the least unlikely."

234. "Exactly.

235. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look at your servant, Bannister."

236. He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fellow of fifty.

237. He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life.

238. His plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.

239. "We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister," said his master.

240. "Yes, sir."

241. "I understand," said Holmes, "that you left your key in the door?"

242. "Yes, sir."

243. "Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?"

244. "It was most unfortunate, sir.

245. But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times."

246. "When did you enter the room?"

247. "It was about half-past four.

248. That is Mr. Soames' tea time."

249. "How long did you stay?"

250. "When I saw that he was absent, I withdrew at once."

251. "Did you look at these papers on the table?"

252. "No, sir-- certainly not."

253. "How came you to leave the key in the door?"

254. "I had the tea-tray in my hand.

255. I thought I would come back for the key.

256. Then I forgot."

257. "Has the outer door a spring lock?"

258. "No, sir."

259. "Then it was open all the time?"

260. "Yes, sir."

261. "Anyone in the room could get out?"

262. "Yes, sir."

263. "When Mr. Soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?"

264. "Yes, sir.

265. Such a thing has never happened during the many years that I have been here.

266. I nearly fainted, sir."

267. "So I understand.

268. Where were you when you began to feel bad?"

269. "Where was I, sir?

270. Why, here, near the door."

271. "That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner.

272. Why did you pass these other chairs?"

273. "I don't know, sir, it didn't matter to me where I sat."

274. "I really don't think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes.

275. He was looking very bad-- quite ghastly."

276. "You stayed here when your master left?"

277. "Only for a minute or so.

278. Then I locked the door and went to my room."

279. "Whom do you suspect?"

280. "Oh, I would not venture to say, sir.

281. I don't believe there is any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by such an action.

282. No, sir, I'll not believe it."

283. "Thank you, that will do," said Holmes.

284. "Oh, one more word.

285. You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is amiss?"

286. "No, sir-- not a word."

287. "You haven't seen any of them?"

288. "No, sir."

289. "Very good.

290. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please."

291. Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom.

292. "Your three birds are all in their nests," said Holmes, looking up.

293. "Halloa!

294. What's that?

295. One of them seems restless enough."

296. It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind.

297. He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.

298. "I should like to have a peep at each of them," said Holmes.

299. "Is it possible?"

300. "No difficulty in the world" Soames answered.

301. "This set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them.

302. Come along, and I will personally conduct you."

303. "No names, please!" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.

304. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand.

305. There were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within.

306. Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own.

307. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the Indian-- a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance, and was obviously glad when Holmes's architectural studies had come to an end.

308. I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.

309. Only at the third did our visit prove abortive.

310. The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it.

311. "I don't care who you are.

312. You can go to blazes!" roared the angry voice.

313. "Tomorrow's the exam, and I won't be drawn by anyone."

314. "A rude fellow," said our guide, flushing with anger as we withdrew down the stair.

315. "Of course, he did not realize that it was I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather suspicious."

316. Holmes's response was a curious one.

317. "Can you tell me his exact height?" he asked.

318. "Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say.

319. He is taller than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist.

320. I suppose five foot six would be about it."

321. "That is very important," said Holmes.

322. "And now, Mr. Soames, I wish you good-night."

323. Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay.

324. "Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion!

325. You don't seem to realize the position.

326. To-morrow is the examination.

327. I must take some definite action to-night.

328. I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with.

329. The situation must be faced."

330. "You must leave it as it is.

331. I shall drop round early to-morrow morning and chat the matter over.

332. It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.

333. Meanwhile, you change nothing-- nothing at all."

334. "Very good, Mr. Holmes."

335. "You can be perfectly easy in your mind.

336. We shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties.

337. I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings.

338. Good-bye."

339. When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows.

340. The Indian still paced his room.

341. The others were invisible.

342. "Well, Watson, what do you think of it?"

343. Holmes asked, as we came out into the main street.

344. "Quite a little parlour game-- sort of three-card trick, is it not?

345. There are your three men.

346. It must be one of them.

347. You take your choice.

348. Which is yours?"

349. "The foul-mouthed fellow at the top.

350. He is the one with the worst record.

351. And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also.

352. Why should he be pacing his room all the time?"

353. "There is nothing in that.

354. Many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart."

355. "He looked at us in a queer way."

356. "So would you, if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were preparing for an examination next day, and every moment was of value.

357. No, I see nothing in that.

358. Pencils, too, and knives-- all was satisfactory.

359. But that fellow DOES puzzle me."

360. "Who?"

361. "Why, Bannister, the servant.

362. What's his game in the matter?"

363. "He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man."

364. "So he did me.

365. That's the puzzling part.

366. Why should a perfectly honest man-- Well, well, here's a large stationer's.

367. We shall begin our researches here."

368. There were only four stationers of any consequences in the town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a duplicate.

369. All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock.

370. My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.

371. "No good, my dear Watson.

372. This, the best and only final clue, has run to nothing.

373. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it.

374. By Jove! my dear fellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas at seven-thirty.

375. What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to quit, and that I shall share your downfall-- not, however, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant, and the three enterprising students."

376. Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.

377. At eight in the morning, he came into my room just as I finished my toilet.

378. "Well, Watson," said he, "it is time we went down to St. Luke's.

379. Can you do without breakfast?"

380. "Certainly."

381. "Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him something positive."

382. "Have you anything positive to tell him?"

383. "I think so."

384. "You have formed a conclusion?"

385. "Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery."

386. "But what fresh evidence could you have got?"

387. "Aha!

388. It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six.

389. I have put in two hours' hard work and covered at least five miles, with something to show for it.

390. Look at that!"

391. He held out his hand.

392. On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.

393. "Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday."

394. "And one more this morning.

395. It is a fair argument that wherever No. 3 came from is also the source of Nos. 1 and 2.

396. Eh, Watson?

397. Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his pain."

398. The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers.

399. In a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship.

400. He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.

401. "Thank heaven that you have come!

402. I feared that you had given it up in despair.

403. What am I to do?

404. Shall the examination proceed?"

405. "Yes, let it proceed, by all means."

406. "But this rascal?"

407. "He shall not compete."

408. "You know him?"

409. "I think so.

410. If this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court-martial.

411. You there, if you please, Soames!

412. Watson you here!

413. I'll take the armchair in the middle.

414. I think that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast.

415. Kindly ring the bell!"

416. Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance.

417. "You will kindly close the door," said Holmes.

418. "Now, Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday's incident?"

419. The man turned white to the roots of his hair.

420. "I have told you everything, sir."

421. "Nothing to add?"

422. "Nothing at all, sir."

423. "Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you.

424. When you sat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room?"

425. "That's all right," said Lestrade, as we parted.

426. "Hill knows all these gentry, and he will give a name to him.

427. You'll find that my theory of the Mafia will work out all right.

428. But I'm sure I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon him.

429. I don't quite understand it all yet."

430. "I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations," said Holmes.

431. "Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end.

432. If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o'clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business, which presents some features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime.

433. If ever I permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the Napoleonic busts."

434. When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much information concerning our prisoner.

435. His name, it appeared, was Beppo, second name unknown.

436. He was a well-known ne'er-do-well among the Italian colony.

437. He had once been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in jail-- once for a petty theft, and once, as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman.

438. He could talk English perfectly well.

439. His reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject, but the police had discovered that these same busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co.

440. To all this information, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with polite attention, but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to assume.

441. At last he started in his chair, and his eyes brightened.

442. There had been a ring at the bell.

443. A minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an elderly red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in.

444. In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.

445. "Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?"

446. My friend bowed and smiled.

447. "Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I suppose?" said he.

448. "Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains were awkward.

449. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession."

450. "Exactly."

451. "I have your letter here.

452. You said, 'I desire to possess a copy of Devine's Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession.'

453. Is that right?"

454. "Certainly."

455. "I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing."

456. "Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very simple.

457. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address."

458. "Oh, that was it, was it?

459. Did he tell you what I paid for it?"

460. "No, he did not."

461. "Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one.

462. I only gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that before I take ten pounds from you.

463. "I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford.

464. But I have named that price, so I intend to stick to it."

465. "Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes.

466. I brought the bust up with me, as you asked me to do.

467. Here it is!"

468. He opened his bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more than once in fragments.

469. Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon the table.

470. "You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence of these witnesses.

471. It is simply to say that you transfer every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me.

472. I am a methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards.

473. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good evening."

474. When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes's movements were such as to rivet our attention.

475. He began by taking a clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table.

476. Then he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.

477. Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head.

478. The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains.

479. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding.

480. "Gentlemen," he cried, "let me introduce you to the famous black pearl of the Borgias."

481. Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous impulse, we both broke at clapping, as at the well-wrought crisis of a play.

482. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes's pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his audience.

483. It was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause.

484. The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.

485. "Yes, gentlemen," said he, "it is the most famous pearl now existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna's bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney.

486. You will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the London police to recover it.

487. I was myself consulted upon the case, but I was unable to throw any light upon it.

488. Suspicion fell upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace any connection between them.

489. The maid's name was Lucretia Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother.

490. I have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo, for some crime of violence-- an event which took place in the factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were being made.

491. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they presented themselves to me.

492. Beppo had the pearl in his possession.

493. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his sister.

494. It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.

495. "The main fact is that he HAD the pearl, and at that moment, when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police.

496. He made for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched.

497. Six plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage.

498. One of them was still soft.

499. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture once more.

500. It was an admirable hiding-place.

501. No one could possibly find it.

502. But Beppo was condemned to a year's imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over London.

503. He could not tell which contained his treasure.

504. Only by breaking them could he see.

505. Even shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to it-- as, in fact, it has done.

506. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance.

507. Through a cousin who works with Gelder, he found out the retail firms who had bought the busts.

508. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked down three of them.

509. The pearl was not there.

510. Then, with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in finding out where the other three busts had gone.

511. The first was at Harker's.

512. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed."

513. "If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?"

514. I asked.

515. "As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him from any third person.

516. That was the obvious reason.

517. Well, after the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements.

518. He would fear that the police would read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him.

519. Of course, I could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker's bust.

520. I had not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it.

521. Since Harker's bust was one in three, the chances were exactly as I told you-- two to one against the pearl being inside it.

522. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the London one first.

523. I warned the inmates of the house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with the happiest results.

524. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the Borgia pearl that we were after.

525. The name of the murdered man linked the one event with the other.

526. There only remained a single bust-- the Reading one-- and the pearl must be there.

527. I bought it in your presence from the owner-- and there it lies."

528. We sat in silence for a moment.

529. "Well," said Lestrade, "I've seen you handle a good many cases, Mr. Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than that.

530. We're not jealous of you at Scotland Yard.

531. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow, there's not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the hand."

532. "Thank you!" said Holmes.

533. "Thank you!" and as he turned away, it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I had ever seen him.

534. A moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more.

535. "Put the pearl in the safe, Watson," said he, "and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case.

536. Good-bye, Lestrade.

537. If any little problem comes your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution."
