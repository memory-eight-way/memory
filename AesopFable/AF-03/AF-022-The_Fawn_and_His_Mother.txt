The Fawn and His Mother

1. A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, "You are larger than a dog, and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; why, then, O Mother!

2. do the hounds frighten you so?"

3. She smiled, and said: "I know full well, my son, that all you say is true.

4. I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can."

5. No arguments will give courage to the coward.
