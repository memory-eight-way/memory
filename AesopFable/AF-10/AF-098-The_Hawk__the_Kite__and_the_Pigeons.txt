The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons

1. THE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon the Hawk to defend them.

2. He at once consented.

3. When they had admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a larger number of them in one day than the Kite could pounce upon in a whole year.

4. Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease.
