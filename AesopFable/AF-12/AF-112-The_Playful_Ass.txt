The Playful Ass

1. AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about there, broke in the tiling.

2. The owner went up after him and quickly drove him down, beating him severely with a thick wooden cudgel.

3. The Ass said, "Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing yesterday, and you all laughed heartily, as if it afforded you very great amusement."
