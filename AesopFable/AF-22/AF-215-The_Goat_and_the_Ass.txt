The Goat and the Ass

1. A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass.

2. The Goat, envying the Ass on account of his greater abundance of food, said, "How shamefully you are treated: at one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying heavy burdens;" and he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest.

3. The Ass listened to his words, and falling into a ditch, was very much bruised.

4. His master, sending for a leech, asked his advice.

5. He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat.

6. They at once killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.
