The Fly and the Draught-Mule

1. A FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the Draught-Mule said, "How slow you are!

2. Why do you not go faster?

3. See if I do not prick your neck with my sting."

4. The Draught-Mule replied, "I do not heed your threats; I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my pace with his whip, or holds me back with the reins.

5. Away, therefore, with your insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when to go slow."
