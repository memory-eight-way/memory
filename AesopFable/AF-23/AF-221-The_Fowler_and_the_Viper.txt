The Fowler and the Viper

1. A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch birds.

2. Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky.

3. While thus looking upwards, he unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just before his feet.

4. The Viper, turning about, stung him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, "Woe is me!

5. that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into the snares of death."
