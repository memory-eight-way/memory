The Blind Man and the Whelp

1. A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching them with his hands.

2. The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, with a request that he would feel it, and say what it was.

3. He felt it, and being in doubt, said: "I do not quite know whether it is the cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well.

4. It would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold."

5. Evil tendencies are shown in early life.
