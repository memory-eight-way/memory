The Goat and the Goatherd

1. A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock.

2. He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention to the summons.

3. At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master.

4. The Goat replied, "Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent."

5. Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.
