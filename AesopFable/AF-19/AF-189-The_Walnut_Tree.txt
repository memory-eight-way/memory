The Walnut-Tree

1. A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of fruit.

2. For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its branches with stones and sticks.

3. The Walnut-Tree piteously exclaimed, "O wretched me!

4. that those whom I cheer with my fruit should repay me with these painful requitals!"
