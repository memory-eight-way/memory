The Manslayer

1. A MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the man whom he murdered.

2. On his reaching the river Nile he saw a Lion on its bank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree.

3. He found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree, and again being greatly alarmed, he threw himself into the river, where a crocodile caught him and ate him.

4. Thus the earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to a murderer.
