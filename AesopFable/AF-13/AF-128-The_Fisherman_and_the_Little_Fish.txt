The Fisherman and the Little Fish

1. A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a single small Fish as the result of his day's labor.

2. The Fish, panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life: "O Sir, what good can I be to you, and how little am I worth?

3. I am not yet come to my full size.

4. Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea.

5. I shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you can catch me again, and make a handsome profit of me."

6. The Fisherman replied, "I should indeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I were to forego my present certain gain."
