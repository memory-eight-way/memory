The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle

1. TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard.

2. One at last put the other to flight.

3. The vanquished Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might.

4. An Eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons.

5. The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery.

6. Pride goes before destruction.
