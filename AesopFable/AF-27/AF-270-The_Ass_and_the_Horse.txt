The Ass and the Horse

1. AN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed.

2. "Yes," said the Horse; "if any remains out of what I am now eating I will give it you for the sake of my own superior dignity, and if you will come when I reach my own stall in the evening, I will give you a little sack full of barley."

3. The Ass replied, "Thank you.

4. But I can't think that you, who refuse me a little matter now, will by and by confer on me a greater benefit."
