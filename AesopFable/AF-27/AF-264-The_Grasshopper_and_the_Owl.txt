The Grasshopper and the Owl

1. AN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the day, was greatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and earnestly besought her to stop chirping.

2. The Grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped louder and louder the more the Owl entreated.

3. When she saw that she could get no redress and that her words were despised, the Owl attacked the chatterer by a stratagem.

4. "Since I cannot sleep," she said, "on account of your song which, believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me.

5. If you do not dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together."

6. The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of her voice, eagerly flew up.

7. The Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her, and put her to death.
