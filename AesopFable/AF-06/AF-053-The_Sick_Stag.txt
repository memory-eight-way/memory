The Sick Stag

1. A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground.

2. His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the means of living.

3. Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.
