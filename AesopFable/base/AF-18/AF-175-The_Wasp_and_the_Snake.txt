The Wasp and the Snake

1. A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death.

2. The Snake, being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, "At least my enemy and I shall perish together."
