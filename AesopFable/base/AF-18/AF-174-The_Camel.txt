The Camel

1. WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast size that he ran away.

2. After a time, perceiving the meekness and gentleness of the beast's temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him.

3. Soon afterwards, observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in spirit, he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a child drive him.

4. Use serves to overcome dread.
