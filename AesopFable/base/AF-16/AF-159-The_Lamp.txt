The Lamp

1. A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted that it gave more light than the sun.

2. Then a sudden puff of wind arose, and the Lamp was immediately extinguished.

3. Its owner lit it again, and said: "Boast no more, but henceforth be content to give thy light in silence.

4. Know that not even the stars need to be relit."
