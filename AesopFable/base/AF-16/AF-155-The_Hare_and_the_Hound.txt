The Hare and the Hound

1. A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave up the chase.

2. A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying "The little one is the best runner of the two."

3. The Hound replied, "You do not see the difference between us: I was only running for a dinner, but he for his life."
