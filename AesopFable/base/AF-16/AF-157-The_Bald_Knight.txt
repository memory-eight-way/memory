The Bald Knight

1. A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt.

2. A sudden puff of wind blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang forth from his companions.

3. He pulled up his horse, and with great glee joined in the joke by saying, "What a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine should fly from me, when they have forsaken even the man on whose head they grew."
