The Boy and the Nettles

1. A BOY was stung by a Nettle.

2. He ran home and told his Mother, saying, "Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently."

3. "That was just why it stung you," said his Mother.

4. "The next time you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and not in the least hurt you."

5. Whatever you do, do with all your might.
