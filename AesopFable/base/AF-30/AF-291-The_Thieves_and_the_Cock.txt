The Thieves and the Cock

1. SOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock, whom they stole, and got off as fast as they could.

2. Upon arriving at home they prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life: "Pray spare me; I am very serviceable to men.

3. I wake them up in the night to their work."

4. "That is the very reason why we must the more kill you," they replied; "for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our business."

5. The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions.
