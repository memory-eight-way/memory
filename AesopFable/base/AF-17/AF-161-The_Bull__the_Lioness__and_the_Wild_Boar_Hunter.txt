The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter

1. A BULL finding a lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his horns.

2. The Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp.

3. A wild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a distance and said to her, "Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss of their children, whose deaths have been caused by you."
