The Horse and the Ass

1. A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway.

2. The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way.

3. "Hardly," said the Horse, "can I resist kicking you with my heels."

4. The Ass held his peace, and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods.

5. Not long afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by his owner to the farm.

6. The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him: "Where, O boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?"
