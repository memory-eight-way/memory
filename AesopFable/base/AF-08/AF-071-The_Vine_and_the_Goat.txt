The Vine and the Goat

1. A VINE was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes.

2. A Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves.

3. The Vine addressed him and said: "Why do you thus injure me without a cause, and crop my leaves?

4. Is there no young grass left?

5. But I shall not have to wait long for my just revenge; for if you now should crop my leaves, and cut me down to my root, I shall provide the wine to pour over you when you are led as a victim to the sacrifice."
