The Kid and the Wolf

1. A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him.

2. The Wolf, looking up, said, "Sirrah!

3. I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing."

4. Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the strong.
