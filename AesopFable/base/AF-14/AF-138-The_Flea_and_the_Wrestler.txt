The Flea and the Wrestler

1. A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him, causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help.

2. When the Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, "O Hercules!

3. if you will not help me against a Flea, how can I hope for your assistance against greater antagonists?"
