The Hen and the Swallow

1. A HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them warm, nourished them into life.

2. A Swallow, observing what she had done, said, "You silly creature!

3. why have you hatched these vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?"
