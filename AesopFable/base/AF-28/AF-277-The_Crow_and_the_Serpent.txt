The Crow and the Serpent

1. A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook, and flying down, greedily seized him.

2. The Serpent, turning about, bit the Crow with a mortal wound.

3. In the agony of death, the bird exclaimed: "O unhappy me!

4. who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction."
