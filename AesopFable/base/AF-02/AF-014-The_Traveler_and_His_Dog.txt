The Traveler and His Dog

1. A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself.

2. He asked him sharply: "Why do you stand there gaping?

3. Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly."

4. The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: "O, master!

5. I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting."

6. The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.
