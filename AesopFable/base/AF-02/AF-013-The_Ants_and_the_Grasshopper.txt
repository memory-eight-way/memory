The Ants and the Grasshopper

1. THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected in the summertime.

2. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food.

3. The Ants inquired of him, "Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?"

4. He replied, "I had not leisure enough.

5. I passed the days in singing."

6. They then said in derision: "If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter."
