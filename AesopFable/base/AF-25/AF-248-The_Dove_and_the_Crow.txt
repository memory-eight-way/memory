The Dove and the Crow

1. A DOVE shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of young ones which she had hatched.

2. A Crow hearing her, said: "My good friend, cease from this unseasonable boasting.

3. The larger the number of your family, the greater your cause of sorrow, in seeing them shut up in this prison-house."
