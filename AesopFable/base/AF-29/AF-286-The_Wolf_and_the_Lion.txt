The Wolf and the Lion

1. A WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off to his lair.

2. A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it from him.

3. Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, "You have unrighteously taken that which was mine from me!"

4. To which the Lion jeeringly replied, "It was righteously yours, eh?

5. The gift of a friend?"
