The Crow and the Sheep

1. A TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a Sheep.

2. The Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time, and at last said, "If you had treated a dog in this way, you would have had your deserts from his sharp teeth."

3. To this the Crow replied, "I despise the weak and yield to the strong.

4. I know whom I may bully and whom I must flatter; and I thus prolong my life to a good old age."
