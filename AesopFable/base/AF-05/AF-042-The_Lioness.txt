The Lioness

1. A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth.

2. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute.

3. "And you," they said, "how many sons have you at a birth?"

4. The Lioness laughed at them, and said: "Why!

5. I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred Lion."

6. The value is in the worth, not in the number.
