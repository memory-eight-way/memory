The Wolf and the Sheep

1. A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in his lair.

2. Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was passing, and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him.

3. "For," he said, "if you will bring me drink, I will find means to provide myself with meat."

4. "Yes," said the Sheep, "if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless make me provide the meat also."

5. Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.
