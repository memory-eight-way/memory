The Boy Hunting Locusts

1. A BOY was hunting for locusts.

2. He had caught a goodly number, when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to take him.

3. The Scorpion, showing his sting, said: "If you had but touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts too!"
