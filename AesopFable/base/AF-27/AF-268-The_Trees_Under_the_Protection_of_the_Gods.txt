The Trees Under the Protection of the Gods

1. THE GODS, according to an ancient legend, made choice of certain trees to be under their special protection.

2. Jupiter chose the oak, Venus the myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and Hercules the poplar.

3. Minerva, wondering why they had preferred trees not yielding fruit, inquired the reason for their choice.

4. Jupiter replied, "It is lest we should seem to covet the honor for the fruit."

5. But said Minerva, "Let anyone say what he will the olive is more dear to me on account of its fruit."

6. Then said Jupiter, "My daughter, you are rightly called wise; for unless what we do is useful, the glory of it is vain."
