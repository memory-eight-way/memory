The Crow and Mercury

1. A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine.

2. But when rescued from his danger, he forgot his promise.

3. Shortly afterwards, again caught in a snare, he passed by Apollo and made the same promise to offer frankincense to Mercury.

4. Mercury soon appeared and said to him, "O thou most base fellow?

5. how can I believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?"
