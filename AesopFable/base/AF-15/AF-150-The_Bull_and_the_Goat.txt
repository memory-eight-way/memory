The Bull and the Goat

1. A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds had recently occupied.

2. As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his horns.

3. The Bull quietly addressed him: "Butt away as much as you will.

4. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion.

5. Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a Bull."

6. It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress.
