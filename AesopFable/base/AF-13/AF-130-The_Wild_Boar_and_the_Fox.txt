The Wild Boar and the Fox

1. A WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the trunk.

2. A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his teeth when there was no danger threatening from either huntsman or hound.

3. He replied, "I do it advisedly; for it would never do to have to sharpen my weapons just at the time I ought to be using them."
