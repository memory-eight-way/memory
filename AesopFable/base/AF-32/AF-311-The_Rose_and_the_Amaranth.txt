The Rose and the Amaranth

1. AN AMARANTH planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed it: "What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike with Gods and with men.

2. I envy you your beauty and your perfume."

3. The Rose replied, "I indeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season!

4. If no cruel hand pluck me from my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom.

5. But thou art immortal and dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed youth."
