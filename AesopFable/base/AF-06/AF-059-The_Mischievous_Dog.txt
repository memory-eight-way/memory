The Mischievous Dog

1. A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to bite them without notice.

2. His master suspended a bell about his neck so that the Dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went.

3. Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the marketplace.

4. One day an old hound said to him: "Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself?

5. That bell that you carry is not, believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered dog."

6. Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
