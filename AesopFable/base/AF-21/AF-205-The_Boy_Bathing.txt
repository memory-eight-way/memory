The Boy Bathing

1. A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned.

2. He called out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding out a helping hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded the boy for his imprudence.

3. "Oh, sir!" cried the youth, "pray help me now and scold me afterwards."

4. Counsel without help is useless.
