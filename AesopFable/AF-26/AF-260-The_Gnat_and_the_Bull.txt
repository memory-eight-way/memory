The Gnat and the Bull

1. A GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time.

2. Just as he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and inquired of the Bull if he would like him to go.

3. The Bull replied, "I did not know you had come, and I shall not miss you when you go away."

4. Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors.
