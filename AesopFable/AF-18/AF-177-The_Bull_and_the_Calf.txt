The Bull and the Calf

1. A BULL was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through a narrow passage which led to his stall.

2. A young Calf came up, and offered to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass.

3. "Save yourself the trouble," said the Bull; "I knew that way long before you were born."
