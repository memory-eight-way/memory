The Thrush and the Fowler

1. A THRUSH was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it because its berries were so delicious.

2. A Fowler observed her staying so long in one spot, and having well bird-limed his reeds, caught her.

3. The Thrush, being at the point of death, exclaimed, "O foolish creature that I am!

4. For the sake of a little pleasant food I have deprived myself of my life."
