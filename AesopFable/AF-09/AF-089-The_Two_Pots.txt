The Two Pots

1. A RIVER carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of earthenware and the other of brass.

2. The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, "Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch me ever so slightly, I shall be broken in pieces, and besides, I by no means wish to come near you."

3. Equals make the best friends.
