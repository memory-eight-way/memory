The Crab and Its Mother

1. A CRAB said to her son, "Why do you walk so one-sided, my child?

2. It is far more becoming to go straight forward."

3. The young Crab replied: "Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the straight way, I will promise to walk in it."

4. The Mother tried in vain, and submitted without remonstrance to the reproof of her child.

5. Example is more powerful than precept.
