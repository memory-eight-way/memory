The Mole and His Mother

1. A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: "I am sure than I can see, Mother!"

2. In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, "What is it?"

3. The young Mole said, "It is a pebble."

4. His Mother exclaimed: "My son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell."
