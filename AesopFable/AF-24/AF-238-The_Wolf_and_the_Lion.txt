The Wolf and the Lion

1. ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself, "Why should I, being of such an immense size and extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion?

2. Ought I not to be acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?"

3. While he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and killed him.

4. He exclaimed with a too late repentance, "Wretched me!

5. this overestimation of myself is the cause of my destruction."
