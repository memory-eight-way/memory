The Dog's House

1. IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible on account of the cold, determined to make himself a house.

2. However when the summer returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a great size.

3. Now he considered that it would be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would accommodate him.
